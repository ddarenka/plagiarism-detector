### 
# Key Integration Points:

# Re-ranking Logic:
# The rerank_tokens method is conceptual and needs actual implementation based on your re-ranking model's specifics. 
# It's intended to adjust the order of candidate tokens (or text segments) 
# based on their relevance to a query token, utilizing the reranker model.

# Statistics Calculation:
# The calculate_statistics method and the statistics calculation process 
# in run are designed to quantify the portions of the text identified 
# as citations, plagiarized, and original, based on their lengths.

# Placeholder Methods: 
# The detect_segments method and others like it are placeholders 
# intended for you to integrate actual logic for segment detection
