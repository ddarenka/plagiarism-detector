0,Internet of Things Eco-System Concept for Healthy Eating,7,"Avramenko К., Latysheva Т."," Abstract. A healthy lifestyle is a way of living that lower the risk of being ill or dying early. The article describes how the Internet of Things can improve everyday life, including nutrition and health monitoring. Keywords: Healthy Eating, nutrition, іnternet of Things, information technology, lifestyle INTRODUCTION Ukraine is among the top ten countries with the highest mortality risk from an unbalanced diet, according to a study by The Lancet magazine [1]. Among the main reasons are excessive sugar, salt, and meat consumption. According to WHO, 70% of a person's health depends on what he eats [2]. It has been scientifically proven that irrational nutrition significantly affects a person's life expectancy and leads to the emergence and development of non-infectious diseases: cardiovascular, diabetes, and metabolic disorders. A balanced diet is a unique tool that can strengthen human health, improve the body's adaptive capabilities and, most importantly, prevent the development of many diseases. In turn, the Internet of Things provides powerful tools to collect and process different data. Sensors and devices connected to Internet can be used for monitoring and improving our health and nutrition. Application for planning balanced nutrition Considering the above information, it is advisable to examine the possibility and prospects of developing an information system for planning balanced nutrition. The end product should help the end user to form a personal plan for a balanced diet and provide an opportunity to monitor his eating behavior in the form of statistics. With the help of this application, we want to offer ways to solve the problem of an unhealthy eating trends, such as insufficient information support, spending a lot of time on following a balanced diet, spending a lot of material resources on a balanced diet. It is essential to address these issues, as unhealthy eating is detrimental to our health and overall quality of life. The application should include the following modules: meal planning module: input and processing of personal data, an algorithm for forming a meal plan, planning purchases according to a meal plan; food diary module: logging of consumed products and dishes, reactions of the body to consumed food; food behavior statistics module: generation of reports based on the diary; communication module with specialists: the creation of appointments with specialists. Internet of Things Overview The Internet of Things is the concept of connecting any device (if it has an on/off switch) to the Internet and other connected devices. IoT represents a vast database in which intelligent sharing devices are known through sensors, electronics, system network, and hardware [3]. Communication between devices can occur between different physical objects, for example, in the office / home. Some examples of devices with IoT integration are lighting devices, smoke alarms, etc. Basically, devices that users can connect to any other device or via the Internet. Creating a personal eco-system of connected devices can allow us to bring many smart features into our everyday life. USING IOT FOR HEALTHY EATING The diagram shows an example of IoT eco-system that can be deployed for improving healthy eating [Figure 1]. Figure 1: IoT for Healthy Eating example As we can see from the figure, the following elements are involved in our future eco-system: User. A user is a person who will be the final consumer of the results that will be produced by the eco-system. The user is primarily interested in improving his nutrition. At the moment, he realizes that his diet is unbalanced and far from WHO recommendations. The user is worried about his health and is ready to start improving the quality of his life. However, he has very limited knowledge about balanced nutrition. Smart devices: Smart watches. Smartwatches have become an important device in our life. Heart monitors are included in wearable technologies and are used to measure heart rates. Smartwatches allow measuring spent calories. This could be helpful for people with diabetes, obesity, or other chronic diseases who comply with a specific diet advised by their care providers [4]. Smart scales. The smart scales can now connect to your smartphone and show you a collection of metrics from weight to body composition. Smart refrigerator. The Smart refrigerator not only stores food but also allows you to use the Internet, through which you can access hundreds of different recipes for cooking and even order food from online stores with home delivery. Smart cooking devices. All the functionality of the multicooker and even more will be available on your smartphone. From a distance, you can give commands: cook / do not cook (stew, fry, in general, start cooking), cook at a higher / lower temperature, end one program and switch to another, switch to the dish heating mode, and so on. Applications: Application for creating a personal plan for balanced nutrition. The application should help the end user to form a personal plan for a balanced diet, provide an opportunity to monitor his eating behavior in the form of statistics, and provide an opportunity to receive informational support from nutritionists [5]. Smart home application. Smart Home is an Android/IOS application that allows you to match your lifestyle and seamlessly control all aspects of your property, including lighting, climate, appliances, curtains and blinds, multi-room audio/video, security, digital video surveillance, entertainment and energy saving anywhere in the world. How this will work together. The first part. In real time, the smart watch will collect a certain overflow of parameters about the user, such as his heart rate, activity, the number of calories burned, trends inherent to the user during the day, sleep statistics, and others. These data will be transferred to the user's phone, and part of them will be used by the application for planning a balanced diet. Based on the received data, this application will determine the daily calorie needs of a given user and analyze the user's lifestyle and basic health parameters to take these indicators into account when planning a personalized diet[6]. Smart Scales not only measure weight but are also able to calculate the percentage of muscle mass in the body, measure fluids in the body, and the percentage of bone mass in the body. These indicators will be transmitted to the user's watch and phone. And again, they will be used by the application for planning a balanced diet. With this data, the application for creating personal plan for balanced nutrition can generate more accurate statistics and provide the best recommendations. A smart refrigerator and smart cooking devices are designed to simplify the process of preparing dishes that the application will recommend. Smart functions will help reduce the amount of time spent on cooking, preparing, and purchasing products. The second part. The second part of the user's interaction with the IoT eco-system begins with the moment when the user starts to follow the nutritious plan that the application suggested. According to the concept, the user should log the body's reaction to the nutrition plan. Then the application will start forming statistics, enriching it also with data from smart devices. Thus, we have a continuous interaction process between devices and the user. CONCLUSION In this article, we have described a personalized IoT eco-system that can provide the user with tools to manage and improve their diet. Using a smart watch, smart scales, smart refrigerator, smart devices for cooking, as well as appropriate applications, the user can easily monitor the main indicators of your health, get basic recommendations for healthy eating, follow a meal plan, record changes in the body depending on the food consumed, receive generated personalized nutrition and health statistics, improve and simplify life.

1,Development of a Mathematical Model Determination of the Proximity of Vectors in the Project-Vector Space,11,"Biloshchytskyi A., Kuchansky A., Biloshchytska S., Andrashko Yu., Faizullin A."," As a result of the decomposition of the subject area, the classification of projects of educational environments is made, and the task of optimal management in the design-vector space is formulated. The research enables us to proceed to formalization of educational environment management processes. We will define the basic definition of this part of the research. Definition 1. By project-vector management of educational environments, we will understand the implementation of functions that ensure the organization, planning, and control of the distribution of available resources between the objects of educational environments and ensure their maximum rapid progress in the project-vector space. Mathematically, the multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments will reflect the vectors formed in the project-vector space (direction of change of objects), evaluate and adjust them based on the needs of stakeholders and project goals. The project-vector space contains a set of objects and subjects of the projects developing in time. The development of the objects and subjects of the projects corresponds to the movement in the project-vector space. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments will be carried out through the evaluation of the distance between the vectors reflecting the required and development of objects/subjects of projects. Mathematically, a set of vectors can represent the unit movements of project objects and subjects in the discrete project-vector space. Each vector coordinate represents the place of the object/subject of the project in one of the measurements at the current moment in time. The endpoint of these movements is the end of the project and the collapse of the project-vector space again (for the project that has ended) into a point. Each vector is defined by coordinates that reflect the state at some discrete point in time t of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk in the project space  : A( j ) ( t )  x(j) (t), x(j) (t),..., x(j) (t),..., x(j) (t), k		k1	k2	ki	kp		(1) where x (j) (t) – the coordinate value of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk along the Ni axis in the project-vector space at time t. The motion vector determines the priority measurements (priority values of the project) and is defined through the magnitude of the change in the distance along the given directions per quantum of time. Building an effective project management system is not the ""aspirations"" of individual objects that matter but how similar or different their movement vectors are in the project-vector space. The same vectors mean that the movements of different project objects are equally predetermined. Therefore, a single system (or subsystem) of management of these projects can be created. In order to create an effective multisystem of project management, it is necessary to group projects in such a way that the distance between vectors of projects included in one group is minimal. The coordinates of the vectors in each measurement are as different as the attributes of the objects and subjects of the projects displayed in this measurement. It is necessary to develop a mathematical apparatus for calculating the distance between the directions of development of objects and the subjects of projects. This will make it possible to create optimal functional procedures for the formation of vectors and minimize the time and cost of creating a multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments. The mathematical apparatus of vector algebra is used to calculate the distances between vectors and determine the optimal set of groups of projects (and, respectively, the subsystems of the multisystem of project management). Assume that for some time interval dt the coordinate value of some object/subject Qj of the project Пk change from the value x(j) (t - dt), x(j) (t - dt),..., x(j) (t - dt),..., x(j) (t - dt) , to the value x(j) (t), x(j) (t),...,x(j) (t),...,x(j) (t) k1	k2	ki kp	, где t − instant of time; dt – the time quantum of the discrete project-vector space. Then the value corresponding to the development of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk,can be determined from the formula l (j) (t)  k	, where l (j) (t) − the vector estimate of the change of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk at time t (instantaneous displacement velocity). However, there is one peculiarity in the design-vector space. In operations on vectors, the distance between them in some measurement is given by the difference of coordinates in that measurement. This cannot be used to calculate the degree of proximity of different vectors. Firstly, because the direction of the object/subject cannot be evaluated over small discrete time instants, it is necessary to evaluate them over a sufficiently long-time interval. Secondly, the creation of a single system (subsystem) of management of many projects is based not only on the ""unidirectional"" development of individual objects and subjects of projects but also on their proximity in the project-vector space. For example, whether the same methods or means of project management are used, the same performers, and whether the same input information is used. The two problems will be solved.

2,Investigation of the Algorithm of Near Search of the Compromise Median in the Problem of Collective Ranking of Objects,14,"Bovsunovska M., Hnatiienko H."," Abstract. Many works are devoted to the problem of creating efficient algorithms for solving problems of high dimensionality, when the brute-force search methods become too time-consumin. This work is also devoted to the development of an efficient algorithm in the field of expert evaluation problems, namely, the algorithm for solving the problem of collective evaluation coordination. The main goal of this work is to implement in software the algorithm for the near search of the compromice median, which is sometimes called the GV-median. It is also necessary to investigate the program for performance at different values of input parameters. Keywords: expert evaluation, collective evaluation, coordination of individual expert evaluations, algorithm of near search of GV-median. Introduction. The problem of ordering a set of objects by the degree of manifestation of some properties is one of the most common problems of expert evaluation [1]. This class of problems formalizes a large number of practical problems in various subject areas. Since such problems are NP-hard, much attention is paid by researchers to the development and research of methods that significantly accelerate the finding of solutions to such problems. Usually, the acceleration of problem solutions is carried out due to the successful determination of the problem structure and the successful use of the features of the structure of admissible solutions. Features of nearest search problems. The classification of ranking problems is quite wide. Problems with the following parameters will be considered for the application of the GV-median nearest search algorithm: expert information about the relationship on the set of objects is used: from the expert committee; input information: individual expert assessments; metric for determining the distance between object ranks in the decision space: the module of differences between object ranks; class of relations between objects for which algorithms for finding a solution are built: strict rankings of objects; type of criterion of optimality of the optimization problem: minimax criterion. Software implementation. Python language was chosen for software implementation. One of the most influential disadvantages of Python is the speed of code execution, however, Python programs are usually written much faster due to the relative conciseness of the language and a wide range of libraries. In addition, using Python increases the readability of the code for other developers. Algorithm of the nearest search of the GV-median. The nearest search algorithm can be represented by a sequence of the following steps: Step 1. The input is k rankings of n objects that will be designated Ri , i  1,..., k, and represented as a matrix Ak, n. (1) Let us transform the matrix of object numbers Ak, n in individual rankings of the form (1) into the corresponding matrix of object ranks B k, n. Step 2. Calculate the distance matrix D k, k  between the rankings of the form by the rank mismatch metric using the formula n i	j	i	j l	l (2) where l 1 i denotes the rank of l object in the ranking of i expert Step 3. We look for the maxima along the rows of the matrix D(k,k), and among them we determine the minimum (or minima, if this value is not the only one). This minimum corresponds to the modified GV-median (also called the compromise median). The solution may not be unique. We track the row from which the GV-median was taken and look at the distances for which rankings were calculated in it. This ranking will be considered as a reference. Define the vector of ranks of the reference ranking as Ko  r0 ,..., r0 , and by Ro  a0 ,..., a0 , denote the order of objects in 1	n	1	n the reference ranking. Step 4. Around the reference ranking we look for the closest to it, that is, those that are at a distance of 2. Their number is exactly n 1 ranking. To do this, it is necessary to swap the neighboring elements in pairs and calculate the distance matrix and the modified GV-median for them. If the new median delivers a lower criterion value, it becomes the new reference. The ranking obtained in the end is the closest to the rankings set by the experts for the given criteria. Computational experiment. The tendency of increasing time consumption with increasing number of objects and experts is obvious. By conducting a computational experiment, we will determine the specific time required to solve problems of different dimensions. The computational experiment was conducted for variations of different parameters: with a fixed number of experts k  10 and a variable number of objects 4  n  50 , as well as with a fixed number of objects n  10 and a variable number of experts 4  k  50 . The results of the computational experiment are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Figure 1. Time in seconds to solve the problem with the number of experts 10 k  10 and the number of objects in the rankings from 4 to 50 4  n  50 With a fixed number of objects and a variable number of experts, it is expected that the dependence of the solution time on the number of experts is close to linear. Figure 2. Time in seconds to solve the problem for the number of objects in the rankings 10 n  10 and the number of experts from 4 to 50 4  k  50 It should be noted that the time complexity of the constructed algorithm for the nearest median search is O k 2n2  . The computational experiment also investigated the percentage of improvement of the result compared to the reference ranking. The results are presented in Figure 3. It is obvious that for a small number of experts k  10 the improvement reaches 30% on average. For a larger number of experts 10  k  50 the improvement reaches about 15%. At the same time, the improvement rate of the result when applying the genetic algorithm was only 3-5% [2], however, for a large number of objects n  500. Figure 3. Percentage of improvement of the result (criteria values at the GV- median) for the number of objects n  10 and the number of experts from 4 to 50 4  k  50 Conclusions. Humanity will not abandon the methods of solving the problems of collective coordination for a long time, because expert opinion is the only way to provide an assessment of objects, a full description of all the impacts on which is very complex and confusing. That is why the development and creation of new methods of working with expert assessments is necessary for more efficient use of available resources.

3,Analysis of Host Detection Methods,18,"Buchyk S., Saroka S."," Abstract. New malicious software fills the Internet every day. In this regard, the protection of personal data is currently an important task. The first stage of many computer attacks is intelligence, and one of its mechanisms is port scanning, which allows an attacker to find out which services are running on the desired system. It means that in the future it can prepare and conduct an attack against the detected services and their vulnerabilities. This article provides an information and describes host detection methods. Keywords: host, scanning, Nmap ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP. Internet users pay little attention to the protection of personal data, and they are good prey for hackers. The first step to mastering information is to collect it. Nmap is one of the most common tools for scanning target hosts. This article analyses the methods of their detection. A host is a computer or other device that communicates with other hosts on a network. Hosts on a network include clients and servers that send or receive data, services, or applications [1]. One of the first tasks when investigating any network is to reduce the set of IP ranges to a list of active or interesting hosts. Network and port scanners are the most common tools for collecting information using technical methods. Host discovery methods [2]: ARP scanning is used to scan the local Ethernet network. On most LANs, especially those using the private address ranges provided by RFC 1918, the vast majority of IP addresses are not in use at any given time. When Nmap tries to send a raw IP packet, such as an ICMP echo request, the operating system must determine a hardware destination address (ARP) that matches the target IP address so that it can properly address the Ethernet frame. This requires it to send a series of ARP requests. UDP scanning has no concept of a connection and no equivalent of a TCP SYN packet. If a UDP packet is sent to a closed port, the system will respond with an ICMP port unreachable message. The absence of such a message is interpreted as a port opening signal. However, if the port is blocked by a firewall, the method will return a false response that the port is open. If ICMP port missing messages are blocked, all ports will be displayed open. Also, a limit on the frequency of ICMP packets can be set, which also affects the results given by the method. Ping scanning is a basic network scanning technique used when you want to know which hosts on the network are on. In terms of network scanning, there are the following types of ICMP messages [3]: Type Echo Ping. Echo request messages are also known as ping packets. A commonly used scanning tool is Nmap to perform ping checks and easily identify available hosts. Type Timestamp Ping. A timestamp request message requests system time information from the target host. The response is in decimal format and displays the number of milliseconds since midnight GMT. Type Address Mask Ping. The address mask query message shows the subnet mask used by the target host. This information is useful when mapping networks and determining the size of subnets and network spaces used by organizations. Security-conscious organizations firewalls often filter incoming ICMP messages, so ICMP inspection is not effective. However, ICMP is not filtered on most networks because ICMP messages are often useful for troubleshooting network problems. TCP SYN scanning is used by default. It can be launched quickly and is capable of scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast connection, without being hindered by restrictive firewalls. This type of scanning is non-intrusive and unnoticeable because the TCP connection is never fully established. It works with any TCP stack, regardless of any specific platform features. TCP scanning using the connect system call is the default TCP scanning type when SYN scanning is not available. It occurs when the user does not have privileges to use raw packets or when scanning IPv6 networks. Instead of using raw packets like most other types of scanning, Nmap ""asks"" the operating system to establish a connection to the target machine on a specified port via the connect system call. TCP ACK scanning is similar to TCP SYN scanning. The difference is that the TCP ACK flag is set instead of the SYN flag. Such an ACK packet claims to acknowledge data over an established TCP connection, but no such connection exists. Therefore, remote hosts must always respond with an RST packet, revealing their existence in the process. TCP NULL, FIN and Xmas scanning. Sometimes TCP SYN scanning is not sufficiently stealthy. Some firewalls and packet filters monitor SYN packets to protected ports. There are also programs like Synlogger and Courtney that can detect such scans. The advanced scans discussed here can pass through said obstacles undetected. The common idea of these methods is that closed ports should respond to “unintelligible” packets (packets with unexpected, incorrect, invalid character combinations) with RSTs, while open ports should simply ignore such packets. FIN scan uses “unexpected” FIN packets as a probe, “Xmas tree” scan uses packets with FIN, URG and PUSH flags, null scan uses packets without flags [4]. Some operating systems ignore the standard and send RSTs from open ports when they should simply skip (discard) the packet. Therefore, these types of scans will not work against such systems. IP protocol scanning. This type of scan allows you to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by the target machines. Technically, such scanning has ceased to be a type of port scanning, for which IP protocol numbers are cycled instead of TCP or UDP port numbers [5]. Although the - p option can be used here to select the protocol numbers to scan, the results are output in a port table format, and even use the same scanning engine as the various port scanning options. Figure 1 – Host discovery methods using the NMAP module Analysing the above, we can say that the main mechanism of intelligence is port scanning. It allows the attacker to find out which services are running on the target system and to prepare and conduct a targeted attack against the services and their vulnerabilities.

4,Symmetric Encryption of Messages Based on the Use of Images,21,"Buchyk S., Tsapro D."," Abstract. This work is devoted to the problem of message transmission protection in an unsecured communication channel. It presents possible enhancements of message transmission protection by symmetric encryption creating image arrays using one-way math operations to mix public and private keys and a modified Diffie-Hellman method as a way to exchange private keys in an insecure channel. Keywords: images, Diffie–Hellman method, symmetric encryption, rgb. Nowadays the development of information systems and technologies, global computer systems and multimedia means, the question of ensuring the reliability and safety of data stored in digital form, as well as their reproduction and transmission through information communication channels is becoming more and more urgent and is getting more and more attention than ever. Even ordinary Internet users can become victims of an attack on their personal data or correspondence, as well as small and large companies. So, the focus of our work is on correspondence between users and its protection. One of the solutions that seems most promising is based on computer stenography, an encryption technique, the existence of which an average person is unaware of as there is no substantial evidence about such information or data. According to the basic principle of shorthand, a small amount of critical data is usually mixed with an array of information in such a way that an average user will not be interested in it. One of these arrays can be the most common available media files, e.g., audio, video and images. According to RAS research, about 1.13 trillion photos were taken in 2020 [1]. This means that if we divide this value by the number of people who have a phone or a camera, it will be about 211 photos per person. So, this conveys that most people already have a large number of unique photos in correspondence, which can be used as public keys. Furthermore, lots of people have personal messages that they have not published anywhere and have not forwarded, in case if there is none, then one can take their phone, take a photo and in a minute, they will have a unique private photo. These photos can act as a private key. At this stage, there may be doubts about the use of the symmetric method of encrypting future messages, as it is possible to use an asymmetric one. Still, we will consider the case when it is planned to exchange a large number of messages, and for this the symmetric model is for sure the favourite [2]. The model situation presupposes that you and your interlocutor have public keys and each of you has your own private key. The next step it to exchange private keys so that they are not declassified. The Diffie-Hellman method can be appropriate for this task, which is the use of a one-way mod operation with prime numbers. This method is based on the use of prime numbers for maximum security. So now we have a method of transferring two keys, but the question is raised how to move from theory to practice. The first proposal was to use prime numbers up to 256, that is, to generate a photo by choosing for each of the rgb colors a random prime number in the range from 0 to 255. But, firstly, there are only 53 of such numbers. Secondly, the remainder of dividing by some of them, such as 2 or 3, is too easy to calculate, so they should also be removed. This leads to the fact that out of these 53 at least a couple of numbers will remain, and an image with exactly the same color may raise suspicion even among average users. Therefore, there put forward a method of creating a table that contains 256 prime numbers in ascending order is. In this case you and your interlocutor are able to choose any open image, and even maybe more than one. Furthermore, this solution has a particular advantage as we do not have to take only prime numbers as in the first method, which will significantly increase possible variations, and as a consequence will increase the level of protection of the offered method. There is an example in which mixing means taking a pixel from an open image, separately adding the corresponding color from the rgb of the closed and open image according to the formula (𝑔𝑘mod n)mod 256, where n is a prime number from the table with the corresponding index, which is equal to the value of the base color in the open image, k is the value of the base color in closed + 1 (to avoid the 0 power), g is the product of the values from the table with indices equal to the other two values of the base colors in the open image. There is given an example of Alice and Bob to consider. If to put it briefly, Figure 1 demonstrates how it works, with the remark that instead of four colors, all pixels are presented in the image. That is, Bob takes and mixes his closed image with the open one, and gets the image that he will send to Alice. She, in her turn, performs the same operation and sends the public image mixed with her private key. Next, Bob mixes his closed image with what Alice sent him, and she in her turn performs the same action with what Bob sent to her. In this way, these two will receive the same images that they exchanged in an unsecured channel. That is, if an attacker intercepts all their messages, he will not receive the same image as these two. Figure 1 – Visual demonstration of Diffie–Hellman method work The use of this method will allow users to create a set of images that will be incomprehensible to an average user, later on using this set for symmetric encryption of messages in the future.

5,Use of Forecasting Methods in the Information System of Efficient Water Supply to Prevent Accidents,24,"Buzyurova A., Kiktev N."," Abstract. This article describes the developed information system of efficient water supply based on the parameters obtained from the devices located on the pipes. Keywords: Water supply, costs, humidity, accidents, forecasting, distributed information system, database, application, graphical interface. The article is devoted to issues of notification of the water supply system using the emergency alarm system. The advantages of using an alarm monitoring system are that the alarm warns of moisture on the pipe and protects it from corrosion. With the help of an electronic device, it is possible to monitor the condition of the pipe and register the corresponding indicators, which, if they exceed the norm, can lead to an accident. The issue of improving the calculation and optimization of the water supply system of large cities, taking into account the wear and tear of pipelines, is considered in the dissertation research of Nguen Huy Cuong (Vietnam) [1]. The work [2] describes the creation of the hardware and software complex of the ACS of the Southern water supply zone of the agglomeration with a population of 5 million inhabitants. The development of a three-tier ACS for water supply management is described in the work of researchers from Donetsk National University (Ukraine) [3]. The article [4] describes the energy efficiency management system for pipeline water supply systems based on the information database of daily statistics of energy, hydraulic and production indicators. The issue of modeling and designing hydraulic systems, in particular in agricultural objects, was considered in the work of researchers of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine [5]. The information system that’s being developed will make it possible to make recommendations for repairing the pipe in a certain place before an accident occurs, saving people and businesses from water supply interruptions. At the stage of the database development we will conduct an analysis of the subject area, so we will determine the objects of the subject area and the relationship between them. Objects and attributes of the subject area: Device (number; coordinate x – for placing the device on the diagram; coordinate y – for placing the device on the diagram; pipe number); History of indications (number; number of the device; date – the date of taking the indications; indication – the value of the humidity level in percent; water consumption – the value of water consumption in liters since the beginning of the day); Pipe (id; length; district number; material number; date of last repair); District: (number; name); Material (number; name; moisture level that can withstand this material). In the next step, we will build the logical model itself using the description given above. The result of building the model is shown in fig. 1. Let's move on to creating the application itself. At this stage, we will determine the structure of the application. The application that’s being developed will consist of: a server on which all logical operations will be performed and interaction with the database will take place; web applications – an application for browser users; databases; controllers - devices located on pipes that transmit data to the database. Fig. 1 – Presentation of the logical model Let's start creating a database for application development. At this stage, we use the MySQL Workbench application and create the database itself (according to the model presented in Fig. 1). We will also create tables and data types, define primary, external and unique keys. We will use the JavaScript programming language to connect to the MySQL database from the application. We will demonstrate the execution of the application for users of the Chrome browser. In this application, the content is divided using tabs, which are menus. The user can switch between following menu items: ""Main"", ""Network diagram"", ""Table data"", ""Charts and forecast"". On the main page, the user can see basic information about this system. The network plan, where the devices for measuring humidity are located, the coordinates of which are stored in the database can be seen on the second tab (Fig. 2). Date data, humidity indicators and water consumption for each of the devices in tabular form can be seen on the third tab (Fig. 3). It is possible to select the device through the menu (Fig. 4), the data of which the user wants to receive. The fourth tab contains graphs of indications for each device, which can be selected through the corresponding menu, as in the previous tab (Fig. 5) and forecasts for two parameters, namely the level of humidity and water consumption, created using the selected method. Fig. 2 – Tab with modified network diagram Fig. 3 – Coordinates recorded in the database Fig. 4 – Tab with tabular data (device 1) If the predicted humidity indication is greater than the value recorded in the database for the corresponding material, then the user sees a red message about a possible accident on the pipe and the name of the area that may be left without water supply. The date of the last repair of the pipe is also shown above the first graph. Data on the formation of the message and information about the repair are obtained from the database. Fig. 5 – Tab with graphs and forecasts (device 1, graph by humidity level) Conclusions. As a result of the research, an information system for efficient water supply was developed based on the parameters obtained from the devices located on the pipes. An application has been developed and it can provide the user with a convenient interface for tracking possible accidents in the water supply network, thanks to which the user can make a timely decision to carry out repairs and prevent such a situation.

6,An Approach to Slowly Changing Dimension Data Encryption Using the Scrypt Algorithm,28,"Cherevatov A., Chychkan I."," Reliable algorithms are always needed to ensure protection of data from compromise and illegal interference in processes. There are two main processes in the cryptography, encryption and decryption. In the encryption process the key has been used to convert the plain text into cipher text after which the decryption process takes place, that is, the transformation of encrypted data (automatically or manually) into an unencrypted form. Scrypt is a Password Based Key Derivation function. When we consider a standard approach to hashing a dataset to obtain a password, the algorithm passes through a hash function and generates a password that is stored in the database. If password verification is required, the software will query the database to obtain the user's hash. After that, the password entered by the user passes through the hash function and the obtained result is compared with a record from the database. If they match, the password is correct. Hashed passwords by default remain vulnerable to brute-force attacks, or rainbow attacks, when huge tables of prehashed data are created. In order to protect against brute force attacks, we use a salt. In cryptography, PBKDF1 and PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 1) are key derivation functions with a sliding computational cost, used to reduce vulnerabilities of brute-force attacks [1]. This function receives a password, a salt, and the number of iterations as an input. Inside, the function applies a pseudo- random function in a loop with a given number of iterations. Since this process takes more time than encryption with a standard method, rainbow table type attacks become irrelevant, since table generation now requires much more time and computing resources. Generation of a 1024-bit key with the number of iterations in 4000 takes 0.588 seconds [2]. Whereas derivation functions with a sliding computational cost can still be attacked by parallel operations. Scrypt PBKDF was created. It is a memory intensive algorithm that makes it costly to perform large-scale hardware attacks. As input parameters, the algorithm takes a phrase, a salt, a CPU Cost Parameter(N), a Memory Cost Parameter(R), a Parallelization Parameter(P), and a user-specified output length(dkLen). Smix is a key function inside Scrypt. The number of iterations of the cycle is set by the P parameter, the parallelization parameter. The basic idea of the Smix function is to make cracking unreasonable. Inside a Smix function. There is a BlockSalsa20. This is a block of code whose main idea is do not possess excessive internal parallelism to speed up the function. Based on available data concerning DES, MD5, Blowfish, SHA-256, and Salsa20 cores, we provide the following estimates for the size and performance of cryptographic circuits on a 130 nm process [3]. A DES circuit with ≈ 4000 gates of logic can encrypt data at 2000 Mbps. An MD5 circuit with ≈ 12000 gates of logic can hash data at 2500 Mbps. A SHA256 circuit with ≈ 20000 gates of logic can hash data at 2500 Mbps. A Blowfish circuit with ≈ 22000 gates of logic and 4 kiB of SRAM can encrypt data at 1000 Mbps. A Salsa20/8 circuit with ≈ 24000 gates of logic can output a keystream at 2000 Mbps. Conclusion: As new types of attacks emerge and technologies do not stand still, cybersecurity professionals must create new methods of deterrence and prevention. The report proposes an approach using Scrypt as a data hashing algorithm, which provides a number of advantages, in particular: SHA-512 is significantly faster than PBKDF2, which has been deliberately slowed down, and is designed in such a way that its slowness can be controlled by adjusting the iteration count parameter. And therefore, creating tables for ""rainbow"" attacks and brute force attacks will take catastrophically longer, and since it is proposed to use an algorithm for slowly changing dimensions, the system will not require constant creation of a hash from a data array. It is enough to create it once and recreate it in rare cases.

7,Possibilities of Project Management Using Artificial Intelligence,30,"Chyzhenko V., Kubiavka L."," Abstracts. The world is currently undergoing many changes as technology continues to evolve to improve people's lives. Technological progress has made things that seemed impossible in the last decade a part of modern life. All industries are using technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness while making management reliable, secure and interoperable. The integration of human capabilities and technological systems increases productivity and ensures continuous improvement. The combination of technology and human capabilities is also used for project management. Keywords: technological processes, artificial intelligence, project management, automation, integration of human capabilities and technical systems. Introduction. As the use of AI in organizations continues to grow and its benefits remain significant even during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important for project managers to understand where AI can have the greatest impact. Better decision-making and more accurate forecasting of project completion dates. One of the constant tasks of project management is the collection of sufficiently accurate and up-to-date information for making informed decisions. The ability of artificial intelligence to process huge data sets in real-time and changing organizational mindsets can help bridge this gap and facilitate the decision-making process. The ability to connect different types of information and find problems that people would otherwise have missed can be a real turning point for project management. AI has the potential to detect (in real-time) anomalies in datasets and alert managers to project changes (schedule, budget, timelines, project funding...) that could have a significant impact on the project. Ideally, an AI system automatically outputs data critical to project success, making it easier for senior management to make the right decisions [1]. AI can help contextualize data by providing more information than traditional systems provide, linking data to information from other parts of the system, adding meaning to that particular set of data (often related to context: constraints, requirements, etc.). Artificial intelligence and contextual data can play a key role in filling the knowledge gaps and reducing the uncertainty associated with emerging markets, and enabling companies to deploy continuous real-time analytics for rapid decision-making. AI has the potential to detect new trends and indicate to the project manager when a new variable may affect how projects unfold (for example, if a new type of delay appears). This will allow the project manager to stay abreast of the latest data that affects the project's schedule, budget, or schedule [2]. Automation of routine administrative tasks. Active AI assistance or AI virtual assistants are playing an increasing role in eliminating repetitive lower-level tasks, freeing project managers from routine tasks such as meeting scheduling, reminders, daily updates, report preparation, data entry and collection, error detection, and other tasks. By saving time with artificial intelligence in the project management process, project managers can focus on complex higher-level activities that are more important to them, such as planning and customer engagement. In addition to performing the mundane tasks of a project manager, such as an administrator, AI technologies can automate repetitive decision-making processes. Better perception of information and identification of risks. Thanks to its computing power, AI is able to quickly run multiple scenarios and assess the risks of future projects. Unlike current tools that need to be pointed in the right direction, a deep learning algorithm can potentially identify potential risks without being asked. This ability to process massive datasets ensures that issues and dependencies that would otherwise go unnoticed are captured during modeling and improve the quality of the proposed mitigation plan. And it can repeat the calculation when new updated data arrives. The main areas where artificial intelligence systems offer the greatest potential for project risk management are: creation of more accurate cost and time forecasts using empirical data, thus reducing costs and time overruns in portfolios; early identification of problems in projects (with the help of data analytics, project managers can accurately determine which of their projects have the greatest risk of over-execution and under-execution, and therefore determine the actions that will have the greatest impact on problematic projects); developing more effective mitigation plans and finding better solutions for risk management that have been implemented; improvement of adaptation and training [3]. Resource management and capacity planning. Artificial intelligence systems enable project managers to better execute future projects through more efficient allocation of resources. As a result, organizations can anticipate needs and adapt schedules accordingly. The ideal AI system will assist project managers with capacity planning strategies that consider all relevant aspects of the project, including manpower, facilities, schedules, budgets and supplies. A byproduct of this advanced planning is a happier workforce as tasks are delegated based on past performance and overall capacity employee AI can help improve the processes used to manage people, including: calculation of the best distribution of resources and forecasting the deficit or surplus of resources; determination of the right skills for the right job; providing feedback on the implementation of the project; determination of special training for a specific employee; increasing the productivity of capital (reducing obstacles for employees can have a significant impact on the company's efficiency) [4]. With artificial intelligence as a complement to humans, design decisions will be based on a larger set of data and with greater computing power. This will broaden the project manager's view of the entire project landscape and allow him to react more quickly and offer better solutions to the changing business environment. Although AI will obviously have a major impact on project management, artificial intelligence is not human. Human skills such as empathy, emotional intelligence, negotiation, decision-making and human resource management will be valued in the near future—perhaps more than ever.

8,Results of the Study of the State of Information Security in the Medical Information System,33,"Dakov S., Holubnycha A."," Abstract. An examination was conducted of the medical information system (MIS), which provides telemedicine services. Introduction MIS provides online communication with leading doctors of the country who work in private and public medical institutions of Ukraine. Electronic MIS provides the ability to exchange data with the central database of the electronic health care system through an open application software interface. Basic material During the analysis of the company's documentation for compliance with Ukrainian regulations on information protection, personal data (PD) protection, information security, a number of points were found that seemed suspicious or that are a violation of Ukrainian legislation. National regulatory documents [1-7] were taken as the basis for the research. The Public Offer Agreement and the company's Privacy Policy were subjected to careful analysis. The next stage of the study was registration on the website and an online consultation with a doctor in MIS. During this stage, a number of controversial issues were also identified regarding the fulfillment of the requirements of Ukrainian legislation and the company's internal documentation. For example, there are no clear provisions in the resource documentation regarding the issuance of sick leave, although such services are provided. Another point is that you need to add a card to pay for the service. To do this, you need to enter bankcard data on the platform. This moment is a threat to the security of the data and can lead to its theft by the administrators of the information system (IS) or other persons involved in this. Regarding the consultation process itself, I can say that I am skeptical about this format of providing medical services. The dialogue is short, the answers are monosyllabic, and there is no feeling of ""inclusion"" in the process. I consider this a big drawback. In addition, you can get an answer from your family doctor free to all questions for which it is possible to get a consultation online for technical reasons. As for the topic of collection of PD during consultations, no special issues arose here. Next, my goal was to analyze the work of IS with PD at the stages of registration and online consultation with a doctor. When registering, we are asked to enter a phone number, which is necessary for user verification by sending an SMS message. There are no questions here. When filling out the patient's personal office, we are asked to enter their height, weight, blood type, allergies and chronic diseases. It is also possible to create a ""personal medical card"" where photos of tests, examinations, etc. are added. In addition to the photo, it is also necessary to indicate the date, the name of the document and the type of document. This is data containing a medicinal secret. Moreover, with its processing, according to the analysis of the company's documentation, there are some contradictions. For an advisory opinion, data is taken from the patient's personal office. Conclusion In general, the idea is good: quick access to doctor's consultations, a modern solution for a technologically developing society. However, this field requires work with a large number of drugs, some of which are medical secrets. Therefore, the regulatory documents of the company that owns the MIS must contain clear instructions regarding the processing of PD.

9,Using Blockchain for Data Storage,35,"Dakov S., Mohylevych V., Parkhomenko I."," Abstract. The paper considers the use of blockchain for data storage. The main problems in use and possible ways to solve them are considered. Introduction At the heart of the blockchain is a sequence of blocks, each of which carries a certain amount of information. This volume is limited by the technical implementation of the blockchain. The limit shows the maximum file size that can be uploaded to the blockchain. This is sufficient for storing transaction information, however, if you need to store a larger file, you need to look for another solution. Basic material The problem of limiting the maximum block size can be solved in several ways. The simplest of them implies: Splitting a file into segments smaller than the block size. Thus, even the largest file can be written to the blockchain with a small block size. Encryption of data in segments. This will allow you to store information in an open blockchain and be sure of its confidentiality. Distribution of segments on the blockchain network. Thanks to this, the file will be saved in an unchanged form as long as at least one user is synchronized with the blockchain. This approach is borrowed from torrent trackers, but it is not suitable for storing data using the blockchain, even if you remove the fees for creating transactions, for the following reasons: Recording of information in the blockchain is carried out using transactions, which, in turn, require confirmation. A large file can take several thousand transactions, that is, several hours or even days of processing. Information in the blockchain is immutable. Therefore, you cannot delete or modify unnecessary data. All the files that got into the network and their variations will forever remain in the blockchain and theoretically someone will be able to view them sooner or later. Immutability will lead to another problem – an avalanche of blockchain size. If information cannot be deleted, it will only accumulate, eventually making the size of the blockchain too large. Let's consider several examples of using blockchain to store information: BigChainDB cloud storage with huge volume and very fast transactions, it is built on the RethinkDB cluster and uses NoSQL mechanisms to store blocks, thanks to which it has high fault tolerance and bandwidth. BigchainDB is a scalable blockchain database. It is designed to combine the best properties of distributed databases and blockchain. Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform secured by blockchain technology. Sia's storage network uses hard drive capacity around the world, which is used to create a more reliable and cheaper way to store data than traditional cloud storage providers. Sia has its own blockchain and utility token that ensures its operation - Siacoin. MaidSafe is a decentralized internet project. The concept of MaidSafe predates Bitcoin by several years, although it is currently still in beta. When the SAFE network is complete, it will work similarly to the TOR network, meaning that the distribution and access of Internet content will be done in a P2P core network. Conclusion So, there are various options for data storage, but when using the blockchain, it is important to remember that current technologies do not allow storing large amounts of information inside the block chain. Therefore, the blockchain in this industry is used as an intermediary and ledger that monitors compliance with the terms of the agreement on providing storage from one person to another.

10,Unsupervised Concept Learning and Conceptual Structure of Complex Sensory Data,37,Dolgikh S.," Abstract. Conventional methods of analysis of complex sensory data often rely on availability of large collections of data containing significant prior knowledge of the domain, in any of used forms, including training datasets labeled with pre-known truth. Availability or even existence of such data cannot be relied on especially in novel problems and domains where significant amount of confident prior knowledge has not been accumulated. In this work we discuss alternative approaches to analysis of complex sensory data that do not require massive amount of prior knowledge based on unsupervised concept learning and clustering. Keywords: unsupervised learning, Principal Component Analysis, manifold learning, concept learning, clustering. Introduction. Many studies described examples of bias in different practical and functional applications of AI systems, including criminal justice, health care, human resources, social networks and others. Alongside exciting examples of success in many areas, a number of limitations of conventional methods were noted, including dependence on massive of prior data for successful development of functional systems, as well as the problems of explainable and trustworthy AI that are closely related to understanding the reasons why learned systems make certain decisions. In this work we will examine an alternative approach and viewpoint on these problems from the perspective of understanding and analysis of the natural structure of the data itself that does not require massive prior knowledge neither in the form of prior known decisions (that is, labeled datasets) or significant prior knowledge of composition, distribution or characteristics of structure. This direction is generally known as unsupervised concept learning. Methods and approaches in unsupervised concept learning. A number of methods and approaches have been developed in the field of unsupervised concept learning with the objective of describe and characterize conceptual structure of complex sensory data. These include: methods of unsupervised dimensionality reduction, with the objective of reduction of complexity of sensory data that can be both instrumental and important in identification of characteristic types (natural concepts) in the data; methods of unsupervised generative learning with production of informative low-dimensional representations of complex sensory data; informative representations produced by such methods can simplify analysis of characteristic conceptual structure of the data. clustering methods instrumental in confident identification of distinct distributions of subsets of data (including in embeddings and representations of reduced dimensionality) that can be identified with natural types or concepts in the data. statistical methods of analysis of distributions, including identified subsets associated with distinct natural types; and other methods. Linear and Non-linear embeddings. A well-known method of production of informative low dimensional representations (embeddings) of sensory data is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The method identifies linear combinations of observable parameters that produce highest variation in the dataset. PCA is a simple and effective method that can provide important informative conclusions about the distribution of data without any prior knowledge of its content. A downside of the method is it essentially linear nature that can be less effective in analysis of more complex data. Figure 1. Dimensionality reduction of visual data with PCA (dataset of images IRIS, [1]) Limitations of linearity prompted development of methods of non-linear low- dimensionality embedding under general umbrella of manifold learning. Detailed description of these methods falls beyond the limits of this work, however their general objective is to produce low-dimensional embedding or informative representation of the observable data while preserving characteristic inner structure in the data, for example effective distances between samples. These methods can be effective in analysis of more complex data such as interpretation of symbols. To non-linear methods of dimensionality reduction can be also classified methods of generative unsupervised learning that produce informative low- dimensional representations of sensory data learning under the incentive to minimize the distance between the input data and generations produced by the learning model. Natural Conceptual Structure of Complex Sensory Data. We can consider an example of a visual dataset of basic geometrical shapes (Shapes dataset, [2]) that can model a simple but realistic natural environment of a simple biological learning system. The dataset includes grayscale images of triangles, circles and empty backgrounds of variable size and contrast. Different shapes in the set can model different objects in the natural environment of the learning system, for example sources of food versus predators. A method of unsupervised learning with generative neural network model was used to produce low-dimensional representation of the dataset, illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Shapes dataset: 2D embeddings with independently-trained unsupervised generative models (convolutional autoencoder). It can be observed that unsupervised embeddings of the data with selected embedding model (generative self-learning neural network) allows to identify clearly distinct characteristic clusters in the observable data (3 clusters). Importantly, the conclusion that the dataset contained three distinct types of data can be made without any prior knowledge of semantics of the samples or external knowledge about composition of the dataset. Similar results can be obtained with another visual datasets, of grayscale images of digits (Figure 3, manifold learning package umap). Figure 3 Digits dataset: 2D embedding with manifold learning (umap). Cluster structure identified with methods of unsupervised low-dimensional embedding can thus define the natural conceptual structure of the dataset as: 𝐿(𝐷) = { 𝑑𝑗 }, 𝑗 = ̅1̅̅,̅𝑛̅	= 𝐾𝑑(𝐸(𝐷)) where L(D): concepts associated with distinct structures (clusters) in the informative representation; dj: set of distinct clusters in the informative embedding; Kd: method of resolving cluster structure (such as, density clustering); E: embedding of the data D Unsupervised conceptual landscape can provide additional perspective for analysis and applications of the data including: analysis and description of characteristic content of the data, including distributions of identified natural concepts; generation of new data based on identified conceptual structure in the embedding. Importantly, generated datapoints can be associated with concepts of the associated embedded region; confident recognition of natural types (concepts) in the data without requirements for prior labeled data. improvement in classification performance in some scenarios where external class is closely associated with a natural concept. applications in the analysis of bias and trustworthiness of machine intelligence systems. Conclusions. Low-dimensional informative embedding and definition of natural conceptual structure in complex sensory data can provide perspectives in analysis of data even in the absence of large amounts of prior knowledge. For these reasons the approach proposed in this work in our view, merits the attention of the research community.

11,Deep Learning Model in Predicting Diabetes (Type 2),41,"Fedirko Yu., Yehorchenkov O."," Abstract. The purpose of this paper is to present the relevance of predicting diabetes applying artificial neural networks, as well as to developed efficient model. During the research, we've created a deep learning model with accuracy rate 97% using 2 hidden layers neural network. We`ve used Iraqi dataset, having previously processed the data using outlier rejection, data normalization, and attributes selection. Due to research we`ve got a model for determining diabetes with high accuracy using neural network. Keywords: Neural Network, Deep Learning Model, Diabetes, Machine Learning. In 2022, type 2 diabetes mellitus is a common chronic and fatal disease, if not identified in time. 537 million adults (20-79 years) are living with diabetes – it's 1 in 10. This number is predicted to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045 [2, 5]. The earlier and more accurately a diabetic is diagnosed, the more controllable it is, because lifestyle changes and supportive medicine make the life of a sick person no different from a healthy one. However, it is difficult to determine the disease, because many factors provoke it, and most often it is found by chance or in the middle-late stages. Modern solutions in machine learning can help solve this problem. Our analysis was performed on previously tested and pre-prepared data, the latest data provided by the laboratory of the Medical City Hospital [3]. Table 1 Dataset Summary After Preprocessing and Feature Selection For predicting we can use a lot of deep learning technics, but we preserve deep learning models with several layers, as it allows us to make better predictions. Also, as classification and prediction are classical machine learning problems, we expect great accuracy in determining diabetes [1]. Deep learning methods are commonly used in the field of medical forecasting. Many research papers prove that deep learning methods provide better results, reduce the classification error rate, and are more robust to noise than other strategies. The study process includes building models, adding layers, training, and improving performance. For all tasks, we use the common library in machine learning: Tensorflow, Keras, Scipy, and Scikit-learn. If data is less complex and is having fewer dimensions or features then neural networks with 1 to 2 hidden layers would work. If data is having large dimensions or features then to get an optimum solution, 3 to 5 hidden layers can be used. Our data is complex but small, so we've chosen a 2-layer network. This network should be capable of learning relationships in the current shape of data [4]. As the problem of determining diabetes is more classification problem, we used the activation function also on the visible layer in form of the sigmoid (as the value is from 0 to 1). Hidden layers have ReLu, as it is most commonly used and shows better performance. To prevent overfitting or underfitting we use the early stopping method. Once we detect that the validation loss is starting to rise again, we can reset the weights back to where the minimum occurred. This ensures that the model won't continue to learn noise and overfit the data. Training with early stopping also means we're in less danger of stopping the training too early before the network has finished the learning signal. So besides preventing overfitting from training too long, early stopping can also prevent underfitting from not training long enough. We set up 0.001 as a minimum amount of change to count and 20 as the number of epochs to wait before stopping. For the optimizer, we used adam algorithm, which is a stochastic gradient descent method that is based on the adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments. SGD is stochastic in nature as it picks up a “random” instance of training data at each step and then computes the gradient, making it much faster as there are much fewer data to manipulate at a single time, unlike Batch GD. Also, we used binary cross-entropy as a loss function as it is used in binary classification tasks. These are tasks that answer a question with only two choices (diabetic/not diabetic). Figure 1. Validation Loss of proposed model As we observe the training loss and validation loss both decrease and stabilize at a specific point, indicates an optimal fit, this is a model that does not overfit or underfit. Figure 2. Classification Report for proposed model As we can see model has average 98% of accuracy, 99% accuracy in determining diabetes and 89% in non-diabetes. Proposition and further improvements: we propose to use more distributive data, representing more non-diabetes cases, changing structure of hidden layers, changing activation function. Conclusions. In our research, we used neural network as deep learning method, which showed high accuracy. We used eight input instances and one output (CLASS) in the dataset. We used two hidden layers with ReLu activation function and sigmoid function for visible layer. Also, we used optimization technics. Model shows high results for accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. Model provided accuracy near 98%. We proposed further actions in this research, but definitely neural network can be an accurate choice in determining diabetes type 2.

12,Digital Platforms to Deal with the Information Asymmetry Problem,44,"Gaivoronski A., Gorbachuk V., Dunaievskyi M., Suleimanov Seit-Bekir."," Abstract. Market intermediaries coordinate the actions of buyers and sellers. Due to the centralized operation of the platform, the intermediary can add value and capture rents by facilitating the internalization of the externalities related with network effects. The characteristics of intermediaries must meet certain expectations of market participants. Keywords: network effects, intermediated trade, self-selection, decentralized pricing, matching, big data. To understand the choice of an intermediary, let us focus on the organization of exchange of products (goods and services) between sellers and buyers through the two extreme forms of intermediary exchanges, ignoring the other roles that intermediaries often play [1]. In one form of intermediary exchange, the intermediary acts as a dealer (retailer) in a sense it buys products from sellers and resells them to buyers: pricing is centralized by the intermediary. In the second form of intermediary exchange, the intermediary does not take control of the seller’s products, but simply offers access to a platform (or marketplace) where buyers and sellers can interact as they see fit: pricing is decentralized to market participants, and the platform taxes trade. The first form corresponds to a business model in which the dealer sets the wholesale price for sellers and sets the retail price for buyers, and sellers and buyers are price-takers. The second form corresponds to a business model in which the platform operator collects a platform usage charge from each seller and collects a platform usage fee from each buyer, and sellers set retail prices for buyers. Firms carry out transactions, servicing the payment system, inventory control, and record keeping, which are important for the functioning of markets [2]. In addition, firms provide a central place of exchange, thus reducing the search costs for buyers and sellers. By comparing the costs of intermediation with the costs of non-intermediated exchange in the markets, matching buyers and sellers, or the costs of search, it can be shown that an intermediated exchange happens to be more beneficial. Indirect network effects on both sides of the market lead to the concept of so-called two-sided platforms [3]. In such a platform, the primary role of intermediary is to control access to the platform that at least two groups of economic agents use to their interaction. A similar platform should be valued more by users of each group when the platform is used more by another group. Individual decisions to join a particular platform (including Platform as a Service (PaaS)) then generate indirect network effects on agents on the other side of platform [4]. However, in a multi-intermediary world, consumers and suppliers continue to incur search costs due to reacting to multiple intermediaries [5]. Consumers and suppliers discount future net gains due to monetization of search time costs. Consumers have different levels of willingness to pay, suppliers have different opportunity costs, and intermediary firms have different transaction costs. These firms set both bid prices and ask prices. Consumers look for firms that offer a lower purchase price, and suppliers look for firms that offer a higher sale price. Due to such heterogeneity and search costs, the market equilibrium is a distribution of sale prices and a distribution of purchase prices. This equilibrium depends on the discount rate of consumers and suppliers, for whom a higher discount rate stands for a decrease in activity (the number of active consumers and suppliers), while a higher discount rate means an increase in the activity of intermediary firms (the number of active firms): a higher discount rate increases the costs of time-consuming search for consumers and suppliers. Intermediary firms then raise their purchase prices and lower their sale prices because consumers and suppliers are willing to pay a premium to avoid further search, thus increasing the returns to intermediation for firms and stimulating growth in the number of intermediary firms active at the market equilibrium. Thus, the discount rate determines the search costs. When this rate falls to zero, the search costs are eliminated and the relationships between the size of the bid-ask spread and transaction costs are revealed. Then the Walras equilibrium will be the limiting case of the intermediated market when transaction costs fall, and the supply and demand model can be considered an ideal case compatible with the market under consideration at the presence of search costs and price-setting firms. The cloud technologies are saving the general search costs.

13,Creative Methods of Project Management,46,"Gavryliuk V., Khlevnyi A."," Abstract. In the current article the question of creative methods in object management, their importance and methods of application is covered. The main problem is the lack of documented methods for modern object management and search of information sources. In the context of the article highlighted the relevance of this topic and noted the role of creativity in managerial activity. Keywords: creativity, methodology, object management, creative, competence, creative mortgage. Formulation of the problem. Creative methods of approach despite modern trends of practice, a large number of project managers are often ignored project managers. Also known sources of information supply quite a small number of information that to such methods of implementation and approaches in projects. However, creativity is not only innovation and creativity, it is a constructive way of thinking. Creative thinking is a non-standard, original type of thinking that can lead to unexpected decisions or new discoveries. Creativity in business and management is an ability to adapt to new management styles, to change according to changing market conditions and needs. Setting objectives. The main idea of this work was the search for creative methods and approaches. Also search for possibilities of development of creative technologies in modern realities of it-market. Study of peculiarities of implementation of such technologies in projects. Presentation of the main research material. Recently, problems related to managing the creative potential of it project teams are actively discussed in the framework of various profile events and on the pages of periodic editions. The interest to the concept of creative management or creative approach in the solution of project tasks is conditioned by the fundamental importance of this category, from the conceptual conception of which the solution of key problems is expected both in the aspect of application in a particular project, and far beyond it – in the problems of other sciences and spheres of activity of society. The need for creative potential of it- specialists is often stated in many key competencies, which the employer stresses for the description of a particular profile vacancy. This is caused by the situation in the modern business space, when there is a significant increase in inventions due to scientific technological progress, and a passive and culturally limited person, an April, is not able to cope with the flow of information and requirements to it by the surrounding world. The cost for lack of creative approach is to de-define and reduce productivity during the decision of project tasks. Project development consists of actions, and those operations accordingly. If a procedure is carried out, you can imagine every step of it, or have a general idea of it. Creativity is a ""black box"", there is no idea of the mechanism of information processing in it. Creative management is used to process large volumes of information, so it is very important to collect as much information as possible in the investigated area. This is a special condition of a person, in which its worldview, concerns, propensity do not influence the process of information processing. It is desirable to understand the nature of creative management as a perfect mechanism, an invariable, in which there is no need to add anything, development is subject only to the skills of its actual application. Developing in itself as a creative manager can be endless. Creative team management is work with templates of creativity, the pursuit of creativity. There are ""small"" and ""big"" templates. The former have no direct practical benefit, but on their basis they form ""big"" templates, which are divided into relatively stable and unstable (created for each specific project).[11] Creativity is mainly used to form the style and form of presentation of the content. Creativity, unlike creativity, does not remove temporary limitations, but on the contrary, adds them to overcome some of the limitations, and begins to form together with the experience of general project management. Management of complex systems development (31 – 2017) ISSN 2219-5300 76 Creative approach in it projects management begins with search of own understanding and interpretation of project tasks, the accompanying information loses the objective limitation, attention of the project team to separate non-standard ideas or ideas. Accumulated information is consolidated, then compared with what is already known in the subject area, and when receiving a unique result may claim to define a creative product. [10] It projects are the most risky, dynamic projects, characterized by a large number of problems, high stress and conflicts, often require solving unusual tasks, and statistics show only one third of them complete quite successfully.	Introducing a creative approach to it project management, revealing and developing the creative potential of the project team is a necessary condition for solving problems and increasing the efficiency of it projects.	Analysis of the latest research and publications Creative thinking and creativity are undoubtedly useful skills in modern project management. However, the literature still does not provide a comprehensive approach to the formation of a creative thinking team of the project, which would take into account the tools of project management in combination with methods of personnel management. It is from such group characteristics as degree of cohesion and efficiency, common vision of purpose and end result that creative activity and economic effect depend on it. Over time, interest in improving processes in the team has made progress and on its basis a number of creative methods have been created which are quite often used in object management. Analysis of recent research and publications. Method of ""mental maps"" Tony Buzena. Mental maps (diagrams of connections, intelligence-card, etc.) – It is a theory founded by Tony Buzenom, in which the creative process is closely connected with human memory and associated thinking. He proposed to write a key concept in the center of the sheet, and all useful associations – on branches coming from the main word (or problems), around. Next, each association grows with its new association, which expands the possibilities of creating a new idea. Creating such a map helps to develop new social links, and the map image is much better remembered, especially in illustrated form. For creative thinking is especially convenient: On the left edge of the sheet we depict the point of departure, the problem to be solved, and on the right – the ideal solution. Then we will recreate the chain of actions that must connect the two starting points. As a result, a scheme is developed to determine the optimal line of behavior to achieve the goal. In addition, the scheme also shows intermediate tasks, which can be oriented in the creative process. The Smart Card is a powerful graphical method that provides a universal key to unleashing the potential hidden in mind. The sociability of thinking is evidence that the process of processing information in our brain has a non-linear form. Arbitrary opinions never represent a string, direct, logical chain. They are as if spread in different directions from the central idea or image, cutting from one idea to another, ""touching"" all new associations, sometimes quite unexpected. As a result, the opinion often goes far in the direction of the original reference, leads to absolutely unexpected conclusions. The process of learning thinking, as a rule, leads to attempts to organize it, to make consistent and linear. Method of Edward de Bono ""six hats"". In this theory, the famous lateral thinking expert Edward de Bono shows his original approach, which allows to improve the mental process. The method of six hats of thinking is based on the fact that we can think six different ways. The color key is defined to include the appropriate thinking mode, in which the team should be supported, arguing its position in the process of the discussion game: White is the focus of information (analysis of known facts and figures and an assessment of what information is missing and from which sources it can be obtained). Yellow - study of possible success, search for the benefit and optimistic consideration of the predicted events, ideas, situations. Black is an assessment of the situation in terms of shortcomings, risks and threats to its development. Red – attention to emotions, feelings and intuition. Failure in details and conversations, all the intuitive events are expressed at this stage. Green - search for alternatives, generation of ideas, modification of already existing work. Blue - management of the process of the discussion, make conclusions and discuss the use and effectiveness of the method in specific circumstances. Brainstorming is a method of finding new ideas and solutions. The essence of it is that the participants announce as many variants as possible, in particular the most improbable, and then from all of them choose the best ideas or solutions which can be realized in practice.[8] Conclusion. Thus, in modern realities, regardless of the effectiveness of the developed methods there are potentially many undocumented ideas that will help to implement creative technologies in management processes that will solve many modern problems in the development of objects, or processes of product export and save enough amount of company finances. When analyzing information resources, it is possible to notice that the authors allocate improvement of productivity and interest of the working team in the project at introduction of creative methods. The use of such methods provides the possibility of psychological discharge among the staff and improved understanding of problematic places of members.

14,"Project Management of the Development of the Web Platform to Provide Psychological and Career Guidance Support ""My Future Career""",50,"Guzhva Yu., Morozov V."," Abstract. The article describes the problems of providing psychological and career guidance support to schoolchildren and proposes their solution by developing a web platform for providing online consulting services. Keywords: System, psychology, career guidance, IT project, web platform, Kanban, Agile. Introduction One of the results of each person's life is the choice of a future profession, because this choice will be a decisive factor in the formation of a social personality. The most people experience certain difficulties in choosing a future profession and how to master it, and therefore the need for a conscious choice of profession is of the greatest value in adolescence and young adulthood, when certain processes of personality formation take place. psychological qualities, including abilities, interests, value orientations, aspirations, professional plans, ideals, beliefs. It should be noted that when choosing a profession, a person first of all needs psychological help, since he can acquire certain information of a professional nature on his own. Solving a set of problems related to the organization, mental support and information support of the process of professional self-determination of an individual requires making changes in shifting the center of attention to the provision of psychological support [2]. The aim of the research The purpose of the work is the development and planning of the implementation of the web platform service for the comprehensive training of future graduates ""My future career"", which will contribute to the maintenance of the psychological health of schoolchildren and help in determining a profession and a higher educational institution, regardless of their location. Basic material ""My Future Career"" web platform consists of: Functionality of the user: a personal office with a schedule and work plan, homework completion, storage of educational materials. Implementation on the platform of video communication with course teachers, chat with the curator and communication with technical support. Creation of a blog with constant updating of thematic information for users. The system provides an opportunity to leave feedback regarding the course or consultation. The user has the opportunity to edit personal data set up notifications, change the language from 5 possible: Ukrainian, English, Polish, German, French. Functionality for teachers: checking homework and feedback to the student, conducting a lesson broadcast, uploading educational materials, developing a study schedule. Functionality for the administrator: management of the payment system, addition and removal of students from the group, formation of financial reports, reports of learning processes. 4 products: ""What should I know about myself?"" Course, ""What Should I Know About Myself"" Premium Course Including Counseling, ""Choice of a profession"" Course, ""Choice of a profession"" Choice Premium Course including counseling. The course ""What should I know about myself?"" includes the following topics: how to cope with anxiety and stress; emotional intelligence, the importance of mental health and self-care, how to support a loved one, the importance of family in a person's life; spiritual development; the past and how it affects the future; main personality types; self-defense, etc. The premium course to the basic course includes counseling with a psychologist. The course ""Choice of a profession"" deals with topics: career strategies, which myths teenagers face when choosing a profession; what do we actually choose when we talk about a career; what are the stages of choosing a profession and what career strategies exist; what is currently happening in the labor market and what teenagers need to know and be able to be successful; working with professional interests and tasks that we want to solve in the profession and performing a practical test; acquaintance with the main professional areas and professions within them, the practical task of finding several options for professions that may be interesting; self- esteem; work with ""NO""; different classifications of strengths; tests that help determine a teenager's strengths; analysis of the degree of application of one's strengths in the desired direction; 8 main career values, testing to determine personal values, their correlation with desired professions, etc. The premium course ""Choice of a profession"" includes counseling with a career pathologist. Conclusions System development requires a long time and a team of developers. The project development workflow will be managed using the Kanban methodology, which is part of the Agile philosophy. Development according to the Kanban system is one of the most popular for both small and large projects due to its focus on tasks, namely: reducing the number of simultaneously performed tasks and reducing the time for each task, flexibility in decisions made and the frequency of changes in priorities, close interaction between by all team members. The scientific value of the given method lies in the increase efficiency and improvement of existing methods of software development organization [3]. In the future, if the project is successfully implemented, it is possible to create a web and mobile application based on the developed system. Thus, the use of the system is possible regardless of the location of the user. The user receives a result from a new comprehensive approach to providing advice, which solves the following problems: spending a lot of time searching for information; low efficiency of the time used to solve the child's problem; feedback; work with psychological injuries of a child; location dependence; not understanding one's own desires, fears, beliefs. The school provides a working career guidance system. The state more effectively uses budget expenditures for state procurement of universities. Labor productivity increases, high staff turnover decreases. Young people don't waste time learning professions they will never work for.

15,Automated Stakeholder Management System,53,"Hazun H., Morozov V."," Abstract. The project of creating an automated stakeholder management system solves the actual problems of technology companies. The system allows you to manage teams and communication, as well as track the main indicators of projects in real time. Keywords: System, Management System, stakeholder management, Scrum, Jira, project, IT project, analytics, automation, communication. The project to create information technology should meet the needs of the modern market. The project should be relevant, solve the basic needs of companies, and be built based on modern project management approaches. Creating an automated stakeholder management system enables managers and senior management to manage the company and teams effectively. The automated system should include two main types of stakeholders in project management, internal and external. Internal stakeholders are people or groups in a business, such as team members, managers, executive. External stakeholders are people or groups outside the business. These usually include customers, users, suppliers, and investors. Figure 1 - Stakeholder influence There are already systems on the market for organizing the work of companies based on Scrum and Agile. For example, IT companies often use Jira to track current tasks within the Scrum circle. All modern programs help manage specific sections of the project. However, only some products are adapted for use at all stages of the project life cycle, so creating an automated stakeholder management system is a compulsory need for companies. The next essential step at the stage of preparation for the project development is to compile a list of all those interested in participating development and implementation of the project. Involving stakeholders in the project's development helps to determine the information that will be used and reduce unreasonable costs. Stakeholder analysis should be carried out at every project development and implementation stage. Priority and separation of stakeholders by the level of influence allow us to analyze time constraints. For example, lower-level stakeholders communicate within the team, and practical interaction increases according to the stakeholder's influence on the organization's business goals. The IT product's parameters must meet the project's requirements and be constantly checked. Creation a unified management system, it is necessary to determine all indicators, project duration, financial resources, and human potential. All changes must be documented and justified. A unified stakeholder management system includes working with all departments and teams of the company. Its main advantage is its versatility for the personnel department, development team, testers, management, analysts, customer service department, and senior management. Creating an automated system will improve the quality of management of all stakeholders in the company. Stakeholder management systems are fundamental to management processes. Project analytics provided by the system allows understanding of the organization's positioning better and therefore improve the speed of response in the short term and more sound strategic planning in the long term. Consequently, creating an automated stakeholder system helps project managers and teams understand a difficult situation and manage and communicate with stakeholders effectively, allowing them to concentrate resources where the maximum benefit will be obtained. As a result, the team receives a tool for practical work throughout the entire project life cycle.

16,The Problem of Constructing the Ranking of Objects on the Base of Multiple Comparisons for the Cook Metric,55,"Hnatiienko H., Gamotska S., Vlasenko O."," Abstact. The task of determining the ranking of objects, i.e. constructing a linear order, based on multiple comparisons of fixed-length objects specified by experts, is considered. The task has a wide practical application and in the future can be successfully implemented in various spheres of human activity. To formalize the problem, the object rank mismatch metric is used, which is sometimes called Cook's metric. When determining the resulting ranking, it is proposed to use different heuristics that reflect different approaches to understanding the optimality of the resulting ranking. Keywords: object ranking, linear order, multiple comparisons, rank mismatch metric, team, leader Introduction. Many practical life situations do not require a formal straightforward solution, but can be successfully solved by applying special procedures. Such procedures smooth out the initial problem, pre-harmonize the views of different experts on possible solutions to the problem, and thus prepare the team of experts for a compromise solution. The specified procedures cannot be spontaneous or introduced by a spontaneous and volitional method. They should be prepared in advance, formalized, substantiated and researched. Setting of the problem. Let k the experts carry out a preliminary examination of some n projects, objects or applicants for a position from the plural A . According to the terms of the examination, the members of the team (TM) at the first stage should set multiple comparisons (MP) ν of objects, and ν  n . An additional requirement may be a fixed value for all experts. The upper limit of the value is determined by the psycho-physiological capabilities of a person. It cannot be greater, for example, than 9, given the Miller number 7  2 . We will denote that the subset of applicants selected by the i  th TM, on which the TM establishes the order relation in the form of MP, by Aν ,i  I  1,..., k, ν  n . Note that at the initial stage, the number of Cheka and the number of objects coincide: k  n . Without reducing the generality, we will assume that Aν  a j (1) for all TM: j  I . Such a procedure can be considered as an intermediate stage in the transition from informal leadership, that is, the process of influencing the team with the help of one's abilities, skills, to the formal one – the process of influencing people from the position of holding a position. That is, as a result of such elections, a person combines two aspects and becomes a leader: a person who is recognized by the TM as having the right to take the most responsible decisions that affect their interests; the person who is officially entrusted with the functions of managing the team and organizing its activities; a person recognized by the group as authoritative, who enjoys recognition and authority in the group. It is necessary to find the resulting ranking of alternatives, consistent with the given MP of the experts, taking into account the metric of the mismatch of ranks and various criteria. That is, it is necessary to find a reasoned order that is closest to the given expert MPs. Such approaches can be applied in problem groups. The purpose of the procedure of preliminary ranking of objects can be: minimization of the level of conflict that is brewing or has already entered an active stage; a soft check of the level of support of potential leaders in the team assessment of existing groups in the team, i.e. structuring its polarity and thus obtaining more information about the team, distribution of sympathies of the Cheka, popularity and number of leaders, etc.; determining the competence coefficients of the TM, and it is obvious that the experts with the greatest relative competence are the most realistic and can be directly involved in the resolution of the conflict. Characteristics of the team. Note that a team is a set of people united by common activities, common interests, a declared common goal, or to focus their efforts on a project. The collective, in which the preliminary survey is carried out, is characterized by the following factors: existence of a common goal; regular joint activity aimed at achieving the goal; availability of formal and informal leadership; the presence of established industrial and psychological relations between the TM. In this regard, it is necessary to additionally note the features of the preliminary rating: all TM know each other; the evaluation of the applicants of the TM is reliable; each individual evaluation of the TM reflects not the qualities of the candidates for the position, who are elected, but the attitude towards the leaders At the same time, do not focus on the negative and do not organize anti-leadership polls. Formalization of the task of determining the resulting ranking. The most common method of finding the resulting ranking of alternatives is to calculate the median of the given rankings. This group of methods of summarizing expert information is the most reliable and mathematically based. The solutions of the problem, which are determined by applying different metrics and different criteria, are the medians of the linear orders given by the experts. In particular, this is due to the fact that the theory of measurement provides for the definition of average values in the form of medians for ordinal scales. Therefore, the methods of middle ranks, etc., in such cases look at least approximate and doubtful: they cannot provide confidence in the adequate selection of the leader. If you use point scoring to solve this problem, there will definitely be a deviation, because all the TMs are interrelated. After all, the organization is a living organism, and indirectly, the opinions of each TM are not autonomous. Therefore, evaluating possible applicants in points would mean not taking into account, destroying the relationships between TM. In such cases under consideration, instead of point evaluation, ratio evaluation is used in the form of: matrix of pairwise comparisons between objects; object rankings; multiple comparisons between objects; incomplete rankings on multiple objects. Prerequisites to use. For the successful application of the proposed procedure, some preliminary requirements should be established. In particular, the confidentiality and, at the same time, the authenticity of individual MPs should be ensured in order to protect against falsification of results. Maybe you should use hash tables for this. It is also necessary to introduce heuristics for aggregating (smoothing) individual MPs. Heuristics E1. The team exists, it is one. That is, the graph that corresponds to the preferences of the TM, revealed on the basis of the previous vote, although this does not exclude the situation of polypolar leadership. On the basis of given individual MPs, the union of subsets of applicants who got into MPs of type (1) is determined Aλ  A, jI ν  Aλ  A, (2) Definition Let us call the core of leaders of the organization (team) a subset Aλ  A, of the initial set of TM A . Such a statement is fair. Assertion. Only the kernel of type (2), i.e., the union of subsets of applicants, remains for selection and ordering. Sympathies of the TM to other applicants who are not included in the subset (2) do not affect the selection and ordering. Even after the domain of admissible solutions is narrowed down to a subset of (2), the problem is NP-hard, so finding n  10 its solution is problematic. If the selected core of leaders remains large, it is allowed to narrow the core at the expense of those applicants who received support, for example, less than 1-3 votes of the TM. Thus, the computational complexity of the problem is reduced. Heuristics E2. The least popular candidate figures may be removed from the final subset Aλ  A, without significant impact on the final decision. Approaches to determining the resulting ranking of objects. Distances between the rankings of alternatives are determined using Cook's metric of dissimilarity of ranks (places, positions) of alternatives, d R j , Rl   r j  rl , (3) i	i iI where rl  is the rank of i  th alternatives in the ranking of the l  th TM, , Rl , l  L, 1  rl  n. The Cook metric (3) is popular in alternative ranking problems. To use it in solving the task of analyzing incomplete rankings, we will introduce heuristics and, based on them, determine the distances from the rankings given by experts to the reference ranking. To determine the agreed ranking of candidates, we will introduce additional heuristics. Heuristics E3 (maximum satisfaction of desires). Meaning I want all my objects to become winners in the order I specified. Plus the desire to win as much as possible. Thus, the desire of each expert appears to be utopian. But given the fact that they are all in the same conditions, the situation is not so idealized. Let the conditions of the previous (rating) vote determine that ν  3 the TM set the MP in the form a 1 where i1 , i2 , i3  I. Then it is easy to see that when in the options from which a certain ranking is chosen, depending on the sequence of indexes of the objects of the same triple, it is possible to determine the distances for choosing a compromise ranking. For sequences a 1 and a 2 distances are equal to 2. For sequences a 2 a 3 and a 3 distances are equal to 4. l	 1 rl 1 2  rl 2 3  rl , 3 l  I. Heuristic E4 (moderate reciprocity). That is, each TM in conditions of fair voting understands that not everyone can be a winner, that the probability of satisfying all wishes is negligible. Moreover, not one can be defeated, but at least the individual order set by each TM should be preserved: it is important for victory. In this case, the distance from the given individual MPs to the resulting ranking R0  a0 1 is determined as follows: d l  r0  rl r0  rl r0  rl . l  I. V	i1	i1 i2	i2 i3	i3 Conclusion. Thus, a preliminary rating voting procedure for collectives consisting of several dozen members is proposed and studied. This task has been formalized and additional heuristics have been introduced to substantiate the approaches that will be used to determine the resulting ranking of job applicants.

17,Web Application for Ensuring the Communication Between Elements of the Organizational System,59,Hnatiienko O.," Abstract. Web application «Resilience» is described. The software was created by the author in order to ensure stable and quick communication between elements of the organizational system. Forehand informing of relevant services of the organization regarding the state of the system`s elements, occurrence of emergencies, etc. allow to make quality decisions about system reconfiguration on time. Thus, procedures that are replacing executors of specific functions are starting off and ensuring the functional stability of the organizational system. Keywords: functional stability, stable communication, address awareness, decision-making, reconfiguration Introduction. Ensuring the functional stability of the organizational system is the problem of current interest [1]. At the same time, such factors as the efficiency of information exchange between the relevant elements of the system and the correspondence of the information environment that accompanies the system to its real state play an important role. Thereby, the performance of the operating system and its elements, as well as their response to the changes of environment have to come up with adequate, precise, univocal display in the informational support of the system. Formulation of the problem. For a forehanded and qualitative display of the state and the nearest perspectives of the functioning of the system elements, it is essential to create an appropriate toolkit of operational notification. This toolkit should be scalable to all elements of the system. As a result of the implementation of this software in the system of communications between the elements of the system, the need to promptly inform the relevant services of the organizational system must be implemented as well as notification of the direct management of the system elements and their functional management about the nearest plans of the system element. Herewith, the information must be displayed only in cases when deviations from established procedures appear and bring the danger of the negative impact on the normal functions of the elements. Justification  of  the  development  and  use  of  the  web  application «Resilience». It is essential that usage of the web application can bring the same effectiveness in each and every organizational system. The appropriate corporate culture that is maintained in the organizational system plays the main role in creation, implementation and exploitation of the web application. Applying of the web application should also be accompanied by described and implemented procedures, formalized business processes, etc. Also, stuff of the organization should be motivated to strictly follow the procedures related to the use of the web application «Resilience» on a regular basis. Only in this case, the use of such a tool will be effective and efficient. Purpose of the web application. The creation of a web application was motivated by many reasons. In the case of the vigorous activity of a large organization, there are always employees who at every current moment: are on sick leave, on vacation, on business trips; are absent for unknown reasons; have officially taken time off or are unofficially on time off; violate labor discipline; absent due to force majeure; are forced to move due to family circumstances; In all these cases, the timely informing of the management and relevant services of the organizational system can be effectively fulfilled thanks to the developed web application. In the current version web application was developed in the first place with the next aims: prompt informing of target officials about personnel plans; advance semi-official notification by subordinates of their direct management; creation of a local informational environment for cross and preventive informing of interested persons about the nearest likely states of some elements of the organizational system; prediction of possible changes in the activity of system elements; informing about deviations from the standard procedures of system operation; transmission of information about the location and changes in the location of staff; minimization of uncertainty associated with deviations from the standards of actions of some elements of the system. Such informing allows to provide the system with options for a justified redistribution of functions in order to maximize the quality of the functioning of the organizational system [1] by generating options for replacing executors. At the same time, some elements of reconfiguration [2, 3] of the organizational system can be implemented. It means that automated partial restructuring of the information exchange structure or a change in operating procedures can be implemented in the system in order to increase the efficiency of the system's functioning on its available working resources. Features of the web application. Various options for providing a set of functions were considered before creation of the web application; all of them were implemented to improve the sustainable functioning of the organizational system. Firstly, all available applications of today`s market were analyzed: Facebook Messenger, Viber, standard document flow automation systems, Slack, etc. But such systems are multifunctional, difficult in implementation or in usage. Therefore, it was decided to develop a standalone web application. The web application «Resilience» was developed with the no-code platform Thunkable. For now, the web application «Resilience» is PoC (Proof of concept), so it is developed to the level of the concept check. In addition, «Resilience» is a demonstration application of the system that provides an object with information about other surrounding objects. The first page of the application contains two buttons and a text field. The user data is provided when the page is open for the further provision of any information about the user that is to be exchanged in the system. After the user clicks the button “Confirm”, the input name, coordinates, and current time are transferred in the database and the next page opens. The next page contains a text field with the username, map and the button “Update”. When a user goes to this page, the information about other users who have recently used the application gets from database. When clicking on the ""Update"" button, the user data is re-collected and updated in the database, as well as the updated data about other objects are read from the database and displayed on the map. Prospects for improving the web application. In future the improvements of the web application are planned by updates in such areas: decreasing the size of the required disk space for the operation of the application; addition of a menu for some expansion of functions, as well as the possibility of setting recipients: recipient's last name, department, HR department, manager, etc.; ensuring logging of all actions and information received from user applications. Conclusions. A simple and convenient tool for a user and system manager was created in order to maintain quick communication between the elements of the organizational system.

18,"Problems, Features of Software Implementation and Development Perspectives of Some Problems of Digital Agronomy",62,"Hnatiienko V., Hnatiienko H., Yermak V., Zozulia O."," Abstract. Some areas of improvement of digital agronomy tasks and features of creation of appropriate software are considered. Taking into account the world food crisis caused by Russia's war against Ukraine and other factors, the specified direction of research becomes especially relevant. If this problem is not solved comprehensively, by all available methods, the threat of hunger is deepening before the world. Keywords: global food crisis, digital agronomy, crop losses, pattern recognition Introduction. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), compared to the level of 2010, global food production should increase by 70% by 2050. The year 2022 has seen growing crises in various parts of the world, which have been caused by geopolitical, economic and natural causes: extreme heat, floods and droughts caused by climate change. These challenges are compounded by supply chain disruptions and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. After the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a collapse in food supplies and an increase in prices naturally occurred. Wheat prices jumped to their highest level since 2008 in reaction to the 2022 war. At the time of the invasion, Ukraine was the fourth largest exporter of corn and wheat and the largest exporter of sunflower oil in the world. Digital agronomy. One of the ways to increase yield and fight hunger in the world is the use of digital agronomy - the use of indirect methods of measuring physical quantities, which are then converted into agronomic (biological) indicators based on correlation dependence. Digital agronomy is characterized by obtaining various agronomic parameters (availability of nutrients, soil parameters, state of plant development, moisture availability, etc.) by finding a correlation between the measurement of various physical indicators (electrical voltage, light spectrum, temperature and moisture, etc.) and indicators that use in agriculture. The main source of data for digital agronomy is the use of aerial vehicles or artificial Earth satellites. Moreover, the use of satellites is one of the elements of a multi-vector system for monitoring agricultural crops. After all, without a combination with a ground mission, it is impossible to perform a full assessment of the condition of agricultural crops. At the same time, there are many devices, using which you can quickly obtain the values of individual parameters of the condition of plants, soil, etc. These parameters are chlorophyll activity, pH, availability of nutrients, density, soil moisture, and many others. Formulation of the problem. Let there be a set of data characterizing the state of maturity of some field K1. It is also known that retrospective data on the yield of this K2 field in previous cropping seasons. As a result of the data analysis of the K1 and K2 fields, it is possible to determine some dependencies and what the yield was in each plot, for which certain index values are known. The reason for the difference between yields on plots with different vegetation indices is that the harvester is adjusted to the harvesting maturity of the main massif before starting work, without taking into account the mass of small plots that have other indicators. But this unevenness in ripening can be leveled with the help of special drugs. But to determine how expedient it is to use them is already possible to understand the possible volume of crop losses. On the basis of these data, the task arises to obtain an estimate of possible losses that occurred as a result of uneven ripening of grain in a specific field. The task follows from this - based on the evaluation of the unevenness of ripening, understanding the area under the plots with different levels of ripening, to determine the potential losses of the crop sown in the field. Based on the results of solving such a problem, it is possible to better predict crop losses. But it should be noted that in order to increase the yield of agricultural crops at this stage, the management has rather limited management capabilities. Solving the mentioned problems will allow to more accurately determine the moment of harvesting, as well as to reasonably choose the level of adjustment of agricultural machinery. A mathematical model of an effective research tool. For such crops as sunflower, rapeseed, wheat and some others, an agronomic technique called desiccation is traditionally used. It consists in the fact that a special drug is introduced that accelerates ripening and dries the plants. But the drug itself and its introduction are accompanied by additional costs. Therefore, it is important for the farmer to understand whether such costs are justified, because it may happen that the potential losses are much higher than the costs of applying the drug. Neither individual plant protection products nor their systems increase crop yield. They only make it possible to preserve and reduce the loss of what was laid in the genetics of seeds, the fertilizer system, the soil treatment system, natural fertility and so on. And far from always, effective protection at the beginning of the growing season cannot be leveled by subsequent agronomic errors or weather conditions. To build a mathematical model for determining the dependence between the indexing map K1 and the yield map of the same field K2, we will introduce some notations for the neural network and the parameters of this network. Input parameters: p0  seed moisture in the recording area, %; p0  seed moisture ""On a circle"", %; p0  the number of frames involved in the experiment, pcs.; p0  field area, ha; p0  % of the field area; p0  index value; p0  average field index from FarmShots. Output parameters: p1  yield kg per hectare from the field; p1  total weight of seed losses from frames, grams; p1  losses per 1 ha, kg; p1  % losses from productivity per hectare; p1 losses from the field, kg. Let us denote the neural network dependence between the cultivated crop and vegetation indices, which can be determined remotely, through M  p0 , p1 , i  1,..., 7 ; j  1,..., 5 , where p0,i  1,..., 7 is the set of input parameters, p1 , j  1,...,5 is the set of output parameters of the neural network. Therefore, the task of determining the dependence between data sets that correspond to the field with indicators presented on the map K1 and the same field with indicators presented on the map K2 can be formalized as follows: M  p0 , p1   max ,	(1) p0  P0,i  1,..., 7 ; p1  P1, j  1,...,5 ,	(2) where P0 is the set of admissible values of the input parameters, is the set of admissible values of the output parameters. The objective function of type (1) reflects the neural network dependence between the input data, which was reflected on the K1 map, and the output data, which was obtained as a result of the study of the harvest results and was reflected on the K2 map. A constraint of type (2) is a naturally given set of admissible values of the input and output parameters of the mathematical model. Features of information support. When solving the problem of yield maximization, problems arise already at the stage of modeling and information provision. In particular, the tasks of digital agronomy are accompanied by a number of limitations: there is not enough data, the formulation of the task is blurred, the priorities and dependencies are not fully understood, it is not possible to conduct a sufficient number of experiments, the methods of recording crop losses are imperfect, the research results are incomplete, as they are based only on experiments, due to the ubiquitous human factor, the results of experiments may not fully correspond to reality, etc. Compared to biological models, mathematical models look too crude and primitive. This is due, in particular, to the fact that the population is a collection of complexly organized individual organisms. In turn, each organism consists of organs, tissues and cells, carries out metabolic processes, moves, is born, grows, reproduces, ages and dies. And each living cell is a complex heterogeneous system, the volume of which is delimited by membranes and contains subcellular organelles and so on, up to biomacromolecules, amino acids and polypeptides. It is clear that for such systems any mathematics gives only a grossly simplified description. Therefore, in many publications devoted to the remote study of the earth's surface, the need to conduct ground-based research is indicated, and the obtained various indices are the basis for building a plan for field research. In the process of analyzing index maps, it is possible to determine zones in which plants have deviations in some parameters (intensity of photosynthesis, development of biomass, etc.). Analyzing these data, it is possible to determine the number of points of sampling or survey, their coordinates on the field. This improves the quality and accuracy of the examination, makes it possible to determine the level of the problem, and determine their location. Features of software implementation. It was decided to use the Python language to train the neural network for the implementation of model (1)-(2). The program is written in Python, as this programming language contains a large number of libraries for the development of artificial intelligence and data analysis. Thanks to this, it is easy to write simple and understandable code in python, despite the complexity of the tasks that arise during the development of artificial intelligence systems. In this work, a simple fully connected neural network was used to quickly check the presence of connections in the data and obtain approximate results. First, simplified tasks were considered to demonstrate the need for a high-quality dataset - without it, the model cannot be fully applied. It is clear that regardless of the quality of the model, it is impossible to get good results from incorrect data An exploratory data analysis was conducted to identify significant dependencies and clean them up. It turned out that the dataset is too small and when removing some outliers, new ones appeared: due to uneven and sparse distribution, the data were too scattered. It was also experimentally found that deleting data only leads to worse results. The training of the neural network showed that there is a dependence between the data and the output can be obtained with an accuracy of up to 20% of the entire range of possible values of the variable Thus, the use of a simple model on a small dataset demonstrates the presence of dependencies and the feasibility of a more detailed consideration of the issue. Using a full-fledged dataset with a large amount of data and writing a more complex qualitative model configured for a specific task, it is possible to obtain results that adequately model the real situation. In the future, based on the results of the analysis, it is possible to move away from processing the entire field to local processing of areas that have different harvesting qualities. Such an operation can be successfully carried out with the help of drones. Problems. Today, during martial law, it is prohibited to fly drones for commercial purposes. But such a situation is not fixed forever. In addition, these calculations are also important when using ground sprayers: both with continuous treatment and with differentiated introduction of drugs. There is also insufficient cooperation between specialists in business companies and researchers or software developers. It is also necessary to take into account the imperfection of auxiliary methods for determining potential crop losses and the limited possibilities of conducting experiments in the fields. Today, digital agronomy is also characterized by a limited complexity: information collection methods, mathematical methods, agronomic problems, management stages, experiments for learning, research history, etc. Prospects for further research. In order to improve the effectiveness of the application of the described technology, the following promising tools for improving the task can be taken into account in the future. to improve the quality of yield forecasting, it is possible to use various vegetation indices and other indicators (grain moisture, weather conditions), and also conduct experiments with combinations of these indices for one field; conduct research using fuzzy parameter values and apply fuzzy logic tools; to expand the number and geography of researched fields for the purpose of more advanced learning of the neural network; together with the described model, it is promising to solve the problem of automatic recognition of clouds on satellite optical images. Cloud detection is the most important step in the preprocessing of optical satellite images; failure to mask clouds in an image will have a significant negative impact on any crop monitoring analysis. Conclusion. In this work, a mathematical model for determining the neural network dependence between vegetation indices and grain yield losses in the fields is proposed. The degree of reliability of such a model depends on the yield of agricultural crops as a whole, and not only at the stage of harvesting. Prospective approaches to further improvement of approaches and solutions to the issues presented in this work are proposed.

19,Analysis of Data Interpretation with Business Intelligence Tools,67,"Hudymenko M., Shabatska S."," Abstract. Nowadays businesses are moving at neck-breaking speeds and so is their competition. For these businesses to have an edge in the market, every decision they make must be informed. Irrespective of the industry, every business has access to a lot of data that they can leverage to their advantage. The purpose of this paper is to show how Business Intelligence (BI) helps these businesses to use their data to their advantage by presenting the otherwise unusable pile of data into an understandable and interpretable form. Keywords: Business intelligence, data, data warehouse, dashboard. Introduction. Business intelligence combines business analytics, data mining, data visualization, data tools and infrastructure, and best practices to help organizations make more data-driven decisions. Modern BI solutions prioritize flexible self-service analysis, governed data on trusted platforms, empowered business users, and speed to insight. In the development sector, streams of data pass through our hands, inboxes, and online tools every day. But collecting data is much easier than discovering knowledge, and many organizations still struggle to make the most of the data they collect. With the definition of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the development sector has embraced large scale and large volume data use [1]. The human mind is better at understanding pictures and visuals than plain text and numbers. When we look at a table containing a few text labels and numbers, our mind doesn’t interpret that information quickly. It takes some effort for our brain to even understand what is being presented to it. But when the same data is presented in a graphical form, our brain not only quickly understands, but also quickly observes any patterns in the data. This is the power of data visualization and the primary reason why data visualization has become so popular in recent times. Data visualization is an integral part of business intelligence and it helps you to visualize your data as maps or graphs and interact with them [2]. This makes it much easier for the human mind to digest the data and thus allowing it to spot patterns and trends in a much better way. Over the past few years, business intelligence has evolved to include more processes and activities to help improve performance. These processes include: Data mining: Using databases, statistics, and machine learning (ML) to uncover trends in large datasets. Reporting: Sharing data analysis to stakeholders so they can draw conclusions and make decisions. Performance metrics and benchmarking: Comparing current performance data to historical data to track performance against goals, typically using customized dashboards. Descriptive analytics: Using preliminary data analysis to find out what happened. Querying: Asking the data-specific questions, BI pulling the answers from the data sets. Statistical analysis: Taking the results from descriptive analytics and further exploring the data using statistics such as how this trend happened and why. Data visualization: Turning data analysis into visual representations such as charts, graphs, and histograms to more easily consume data. Visual analysis: Exploring data through visual storytelling to communicate insights on the fly and stay in the flow of analysis. Data preparation: Compiling multiple data sources, identifying the dimensions and measurements, and preparing it for data analysis. The data journey methodology consists of four phases: Design, Capture, Understand and Act [3]. They form the starting point for organizations to ensure data is used to contribute to lasting and inclusive impact. These phases aren’t always consecutive or prescriptive, there may be some overlaps, and it may be necessary to go back to a previous phase due to findings at a later stage. Benefits of business intelligence [4]. Great BI helps businesses and organizations ask and answer questions of their data. Some of the top business intelligence benefits include: faster analysis, intuitive dashboards, increased organizational efficiency, data-driven business decisions, improved customer experience, improved employee satisfaction, trusted and governed data, increased competitive advantage. Examples of BI tools [4]: SAP Business Objects/ Intelligence, MicroStrategy, Yellowfin BI, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, QlikSense, Sisense, Oracle BI Conclusion. The effectiveness of BI tool directly proportional to data quality, developers’ team skill and clearly set goal for analytics. BI software connects people with information when and where they need it, and provides capabilities far beyond spreadsheets to deliver a true picture of the business. So having a great business intelligence system is quite essential for every business these days. Having an active vigilance upon the company’s internal processes and its external health is critical for today’s fast-paced businesses. Leveraging data to improve the company should be integral to the business’s core values.

The reasoning for choosing this topic, the methods used in modeling and expectations for the study are described. Keywords: gamification, project management, IT enterprise Turnover is one of the big problems of our society. For example, in 2021 the average annual turnover rate in the USA was 57.3%. That means that over the year, more than half of the employees changed their place of work. Experts say that the average annual turnover rate of 10% or less is the optimal [1]. That ratio varies between different fields and the job itself also makes the difference. Turnover rate in IT industries is around 13.2%. while turnover rate for software developers is almost double of that, sitting at around 21.7%. And while the reasons vary from person to person, one of the bigger reasons is job burnout – a state when the work you once liked no longer brings you satisfaction. With the war raging in Ukraine, many people are afraid to change their place of work. Ministry of Economics approximate the unemployment level at 30% by the end of 2022 [2]. This forces people who no longer enjoy their job to stay, leading to lower motivation and thus lower work efficiency. With the situation at hand, Ukrainian enterprises need ways to enhance work flow to mitigate the crisis. Main ways to prevent burnout include increasing engagement with work by creating a better “fit” between the individual and the job. The second approach draws from the decision-making literature and reframes burnout in terms of how perceptions of the risk of burnout may lead to suboptimal choices that actually increase the likelihood of burning out [6]. However, since burnout is mostly seen as a management or psychological problem, there is little to no research on using software to help mitigate burnout. We believe that software used as the main tool of the job can be helpful in preventing burnout. To do that, we want to address the concept of “gamification”. Gamification works by applying game design principles to non-gaming contexts [3]. The main fields of application include marketing, health, work and education. While there are many studies about the usage of gamification in education, the implications of using gamification in business weren’t studied that much, especially in Ukrainian studies. Game elements that are used in applications are divided into three types: Dynamics, Mechanics and Components. Together they form what is called “The Game Element Hierarchy” [5]. These elements are combined in pairs that are called Narratives [4] and may be described by a bipartite graph. Figure 1 – An example of Narratives During the study we expect to come up with a comprehensive model for gamification for Ukrainian IT industries. This includes finding fields where gamification is applicable and trying to optimize the elements used.

21,Investment Portfolio Construction and Optimization by Means of Data Analysis,71,"Kalinichenko N., Khlevna Iu."," Abstract. In modern portfolio theory, an investor chooses different assets for investment with different levels of risk and expected return. The purpose of this paper is to present a proposal of determining and constructing the most beneficial investment portfolio, in terms of volatility, profit and applicability to different markets. Keywords: Risk, portfolio, returns, volatility, diversification, asset. Introduction. Nowadays, many people are concerned about preserving or increasing the value of their savings. The most reasonable path to turn to is investing into assets. This is a rather complex and extensive process, so the best way to approach it will be discovering the most optimal investment strategy from various points of view. With the results of the research, it will be possible to formulate a successful investment algorithm, depending on the initial variables, such as the type of financial instruments, the type of market, the time available for the construction of the portfolio, the degree of risk aversion of an investor etc. The understanding of the essence of the investment process and assessing the relationship between risk and expected returns can give important insights. In order to grasp it, a simplistic example is proposed. Implementation of the mean-variance analysis according to Markowitz proposition gives the valuable understanding of the power of diversification and shows that it is quite possible to mathematically justify and most importantly evaluate one or another way of constructing an investment portfolio. The numerical data used in the example is price trends of 8 companies’ stocks from the S&P500 index, the largest by market capitalization in 2018 [1, 2]: Apple Inc. Amazon.com, Inc. Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. Facebook Inc. Alphabet Inc. Class A JPMorgan Chase & Co Microsoft Corporation NVIDIA Corporation Using the time series of the returns of the stocks of these companies from 2013 to 2018, re-sampled to the basis of a month, one can obtain the first and second moments of the corresponding eight random variables. Every one of these variables expresses the distribution of the growths of a stock during the period of a month. The following simulation consists of 2,500 investors who randomly invest in stocks of the selected companies. Figure 1 – Efficient frontier and inefficient portfolios on a returns-volatility graph In Figure 1, the efficient frontier [3] is depicted by a green curve. This curve is the locus of the most optimal portfolios (from the point of view of the mean-variance analysis). In other words, this curve displays numerical characteristics (mean and standard deviation) of the least risky portfolios for an arbitrarily chosen value of return. As can be seen from the distribution of the numerical characteristics of the randomly generated portfolios, the overwhelming majority of them are suboptimal, that is, they do not provide sufficient profit compared to the level of risk. Several natural conclusions are to be drawn from this simple experiment: Such a complex process as investing requires mathematical reasoning and rigorous technical justification. Using certain assumptions about the trends of value of assets, it is possible to obtain a quite realistic measure of portfolio optimality. Considering only one of the many models and means of data analysis that can theoretically be used to solve the problems of this subject area can be insufficient. Powerful insights about portfolio construction can be drawn not only by studying the time series of asset values. One cannot fail to mention the factor models [4], which are used to analyze the observed profits. Basically, these are regression models that allow establishing a relationship between investors' returns and various sets of factors. Among the most famous such models are CAPM and the three-factor Fama-French model. Very often investors have additional information about the market situation that does not intersect with the time series of price trends. For example, they might know with extreme certainty that the shares of some company will rise or fall for a particular reason (scientific discovery, natural disaster, legislative changes etc.). The Black- Litterman class of models provides a reasonable way to integrate such knowledge when constructing a portfolio. This model improves the equilibrium allocation of the portfolio using the knowledge of the investor vision on the future tendencies of the asset. The effectiveness of the selected model is directly dependent upon its applicability in a particular field. A careful investigation must take place before applying various strategies and all the results should be verified. One must figure the desired outcome of the data analysis process and also take note of the initial conditions prior to performing any modelling or formulating conclusions. The results of a particular strategy are subject to error, noise pollution, statistical outliers etc. Taking into account all of the above, the following conclusions can be drawn: Development of investment strategies in modern conditions and in various markets is a complex issue and does not have a single definite answer. It is worth constructing an investment portfolio based solely on a set of input data. Any obtained results should be checked for statistical significance.

22,Face Recognition Technology as a Component of Emotional Marketing,74,"Khlevna Iu., Nesterenko Ye."," Abstract. Video surveillance cameras have outlived their function of only recording and displaying the video stream. They have reached the level of automation, cameras are not just equipment for capturing images, but tools for optimising business processes. One of the use cases is video surveillance systems for emotion recognition in marketing. Keywords: Video Surveillance; Marketing Analysis According to a survey by independent research company Gartner [1], almost 30% of marketing executives believe that the lack of sufficient tools to measure the needs of users in the field has negatively affected the implementation of marketing strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic when people's habits have changed in some way. Gartner's experts also concluded that today's marketers need to update information as soon as possible, including processing information from video cameras. Video cameras, especially in combination with video solutions, have really become the tools in which business is interested. For example, in marketing, the main task is to create personalized advertising campaigns. Having data from video cameras another component is added to provide personalized advertising - the emotional state of the client. Any data obtained from various sources should be used to perform logical steps, and if we talk about marketing, one of the goals of using video solutions is to obtain new information about customers based on the analysis of available data. It is relevant to analyze the classification and selection of business tasks, and management decisions which will be based on the processed data from video cameras, to establish the emotional state of the user. An emotion recognition algorithm usually contains six stages: image detection; primary image processing; identification of the person in the image; highlighting the key elements of the person; selection of key points on the face; classification of emotions First, the technology detects the presence of a person's face in the frame, then analyzes anthropometric points. Anthropometric points are points located on the human body, which are formed by the skeleton and are clearly defined by muscles, so they are easily determined. Special algorithms can ""see"" at least 68 such points located along the entire contour of the face, chin, eyes, nose and mouth. After the face has been extracted, it is necessary to have information on the basis of which the emotion analysis will be done. Emotions can be manifested with the help of eyes, eyebrows, and mouth. Therefore, the first step is to find the key points of the selected elements of the person. Usually, the selection of key points is carried out as follows: converting a color image to a halftone; conversion from halftone form to binary focus; application to the binary image of the gradient mask; localization of key points. After selecting the key points, you can perform the classification of the emotion. For example, Table 1 presents the characteristics of emotions by a combination of eyebrows and mouth. Table 1. Characteristics of emotions with a combination of eyebrows and mouth This approach to emotion recognition can be used in various intelligent man- machine systems. Conclusion. For marketing, the area of video solutions, and especially face and emotion recognition systems, is quite an important component nowadays, as marketers are looking for ways to a more personalized approach to the sale of certain groups of goods. Currently, the algorithms available on the market do not yet meet the tasks set by 100%, so there is constant development and improvement of existing methods. Moreover, most of the presented modified methods are used in libraries for working with machine vision, but their source code is always closed, which does not allow full studying of such methods.

23,Recommender Systems for E-Commerce Using Association Rule Learning,76,"Kolumbet A., Khlevnyi A."," Abstract. Modern e-commerce relies on the use of customer data analytics and machine learning to increase sales, this applies both to the customer service area of the online stores themselves and contextual advertising offered by services such as Google. So-called Recommender Systems are designed to increase incremental sales of online stores by analyzing the actions, pages, products and shopping cart of buyers and applying Machine Learning algorithms to find relationships and associations in data and then displaying the recommendation of interest to the potential buyer. Keywords: association rule, machine learning, patterns Introduction. Most used machine learning method in recommender systems development is Association rule learning method. Association rule learning is a rule- based machine learning method for discovering interesting relationships between variables in large databases. It is designed to discover strong rules found in databases by using some curiosity measures. In any given transaction with many items, association rules are designed to discover rules that define how or why certain items are related to each other. Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imielinski and Arun Swamy[1] presented association rules to discover patterns between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, rule {spaghetti + ketchup = cheese}, found in supermarket sales data, indicates that if a customer buys spaghetti and ketchup together, he is likely to also buy cheese to make pasta. Such information can be used as a basis for making decisions about marketing activities such as, for example, promotional pricing or product placement. The purpose of this study is to research development of a machine learning model that can be used to predict interests and recommend products for potential clients of e-commerce businesses that will increase increment sales. Association rule learning works based on the concept of ""If"" and ""Otherwise"" statements, for example, if A, then B. Here the If element is called the antecedent and the Then statement is called the consequent. These types of relationships where we can find some association or connection between two elements are known as single cardinality. It is all about creating rules and if the number of elements increases, then the cardinality also increases accordingly. There are several metrics to measure associations between thousands of data elements. These metrics are Support, Confidence and Lift. Support - is the frequency or occurrence rate of an element in a dataset. It is defined as the fraction of transactions T containing a set of items X. Confidence shows how often a rule turns out to be true. Or how often items X and Y occur together in a data set when the occurrence of X is already given. Confidence shows how often a rule turns out to be true. Or how often items X and Y occur together in a data set when the occurrence of X is already given. Lift - This is the ratio of the measure of observed support and expected support if X and Y are independent of each other. It has three possible values: If Lift=1: The probability of the antecedent and the follower are independent of each other. Lift>1: Determines the level of dependence of two sets of elements on each other. Lift<1: tells us that one element is a substitute for the other elements, which means that one element negatively affects the other. For developing of recommender system F-P growth algorithm can be used. The F-P growth algorithm stands for Frequent Pattern and it is an improved version of the Apriori algorithm. It is a database in the form of a tree-like structure, which is known as a frequent pattern or tree. The purpose of this frequent pattern tree is to extract the most frequently occurring patterns. Fp Growth is a Data Mining model based on association rules. This model allows to determine the set of most frequently occurring association rules in a dataset based on the transaction history. To do this, it requires as input a set of transactions consisting of baskets of products that customers have already purchased. Given a set of transactions, the first step of FP-growth is to calculate the frequencies of items and identify the most frequently occurring items. In the second step, FP-growth uses a suffix tree structure (FP-tree) to encode transactions without explicitly generating candidate sets, which is usually computationally expensive. After the second step, frequent item sets can be extracted from the FP tree and the model returns a set of product association rules, as shown in the example below: {Product A + Product B} --> {Product C} with 60% probability {Product B + Product C} --> {Product A + Product D} with 78% probability {Prodcut C} --> {Product B + Product D} with 67% probability etc. Figure 1 – Construction of FP-tree To create a probability table, the model needs 2 hyperparameters: minSupRatio: the minimum support for a set of elements to be defined as frequent. For example, if an item occurs 3 times out of 5 transactions, its support is 3/5=0.6. minConf: the minimum confidence to create an association rule. Confidence is a measure of how often an association rule is true. For example, if X occurs 4 times in the transaction set, but X and Y occur only 2 times, the confidence of the rule X => Y is 2/4 = 0.5. This parameter does not affect the search for frequent item sets, but defines the minimum confidence for generating associative rules based on frequent item sets. Once the associative rules are calculated, all that remains is to apply them to customer shopping carts.

24,Enterprise Architecture Web Mining Apporach,79,"Kopp A., Orlovskyi D."," Abstract. This paper considers the enterprise architecture model extraction from organizational websites in an automatic way to simplify the blueprinting of enterprise architecture landscapes at the conceptual level. Thus, such a technique is proposed to be called “enterprise architecture web mining”. Keywords: Enterprise Architecture, Business Process, Web Content Mining. This paper proposes an approach and a software tool for the automatic extraction of Enterprise Architecture (EA) landscapes from websites that nowadays virtually represent organizations on the Internet. It aims at simplifying the procedure of building high-level models in the preliminary stages of EA development. It is well known that today most enterprises offer their products and services on their homepages top-ranked by multiple search engines. Usually, organizational websites contain information not only about offered products or services but also about related activities that allow customers to receive respective products or services (e.g. order, buy, learn, etc.). The study object is the procedure of EA structure extraction from organizational websites that serve as virtual enterprise representations on the Internet. The study subject is the approach and software tool to extract EA landscapes from organizational websites. The study goal is to simplify the process of EA description in the early stages of EA development. The suggested “EA web mining” is focused on the automatic construction of EA models using corporate websites as sources of data about EA elements and the relationships between them. Hence, the main problem is finding mentions of business processes and other EA elements in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages of corporate websites. Whereas the direct search in Google Scholar using the “enterprise architecture web mining” key phrase did not give any results, the “enterprise architecture mining” allowed us to discover several studies in this direction. In [1] the author states that manual maintenance of EA models is costly and time-consuming, so they propose EA mining algorithms and tools based on process mining. The study [2] also considers automatic EA modeling methods that are supposed to reduce the drawbacks of manual EA modeling (error-proneness, time and cost consumption, accuracy, etc.). The systematic review [3] also states that automatic EA modeling could respond challenges of manual EA modeling but this field is still immature and requires further research. First of all, the web page should be parsed to work with its tags, their attributes, and text content. Then web page tags should be used to extract the data about the organization’s activity described on its web page on the Internet. Using the structured tag data, business activities that help an organization virtually promote its products or services on the Internet should be detected. Finally, using the set of business activities and the previous outcomes, the EA model should be built. The conceptual model of automatic EA model construction using the company’s homepage on the Internet is demonstrated in Fig. 1. Figure 1 – The conceptual model of “EA web mining” approach The proposed workflow (Fig. 1) should help automatically build high-level architectural models using only the websites of organizations using the suggested technology we can name “enterprise architecture web mining”. Obtained models may describe landscapes of top-level business processes based on products or services offered to customers on the company’s homepage. Moreover, obtained EA models should include application layers to demonstrate website maps, and technology layers to complete the EA cross-layer architecture. However, the most valuable outcome is still a business architecture layer that includes core value-added business processes and the business service offered to the organization’s clients. EA models automatically produced using the company’s website can help to understand the current state of the enterprise, including its customer relationship strategy, offered products, and services. Then, shortcomings could be detected in such an EA model, and the decisions to improve the enterprise’s virtual representation on the Internet could be made.

25,Monitoring IoT Home Devices,81,"Kruk N., Scherbak V., Stepanov M."," Abstract. Current events, namely the coronavirus pandemic and martial law throughout Ukraine, have made adjustments to everyday life. For the sake of life and health, people stay at home most of the time and need constant access to relevant information, such as the state of the air alarm in the village, where there are no sirens as such, but an Internet connection is available. This document analyzes the construction of the infrastructure of the Internet of Things of a small house (home, small office, cottage, etc.), which includes the general coverage of the involved territory, the study of the method of optimal signal retransmission and monitoring of all devices in the system that can be implemented as a home system or a cloud-based solution with remote access to the monitoring of various users, thanks to which the system is constantly monitored and controlled. Keywords: IoT, Wi-Fi, repeater, microcontroller, ESP, C#, HTML, TypeScript, CSS, database, monitoring, SQL Server, application, software product, API, Angular. The modern development of technology is steadily gaining momentum, and a large number of things we are used to, such as a heater, boiler, lighting devices, can be controlled wherever their owner is, provided there is an Internet connection. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has an impact on a large number of areas of human life: health care, business, science, etc. One such application of IoT is the creation of so-called smart homes. A smart home is a home with a network and smart devices aimed at ensuring safety and comfort, as well as energy efficiency - the components of such a system exchange data with each other, and control is often implemented in the form of a convenient application on a smartphone, tablet or other end device. Examples of the improvement of common household items can be: smart TVs that download media content, intelligent lighting systems that save electricity and the working resource of devices, smart thermostats that create the most comfortable conditions at the right time, etc. Obviously, when replacing household items with IoT versions that require Internet connection, it is necessary to provide the house with a stable connection in every corner. However, the coverage area from the home router is often less than desired - in this case, there is a need for expansion. The modern market offers several solutions: Wi-Fi extender from an additional router, commercial Wi-Fi repeater, Wi- Fi repeater based on Raspberry Pi or LuaNode32, etc. According to information found in open sources, instead of using the Raspberry Pi as a computer, it can be used as the basis of a smart home[1] and affordable and budget-friendly ESP microcontrollers support a wide range of technologies, making it possible to build the smart home of your dreams and fully control it[2]. The most profitable of the considered solutions is the repeater based on LuaNode32 (ESP) - in Figure 1, basic information about each of the solutions is collected. Figure 1 – Comparison of solutions Modern smart home complexes usually have a mobile application for control and ongoing monitoring of devices. But usually such solutions have an insufficient level of monitoring and information storage, as well as most of them are focused on the devices of one specific company, which becomes a problem when equipping a smart home with devices from different manufacturers. And applications that allow synchronization of devices work even worse with these devices, and often have problems. Therefore, it is advisable to create an application fully aimed at collecting and storing information from sensors and smart home devices in the form of a web application. Such a software product will allow you to access information from any place and device with an available Internet connection, or when located in the local network where the application is located - the implementation depends on the customer's wishes. Access via the Internet is more comfortable, but access only via a local network is safer. Also, we receive not only current data from devices, but also statistics of their operation over a long period of time, which will allow us to find weak points of the smart home complex, errors, hacking attempts and opportunities for improvement. The monitoring system itself consists of three main parts: database, backend and frontend. SQL Server is recommended as a database due to its convenience and availability, although other options can be used. The server-client part should be developed using the MVC design template[3] – Model, View, Controller. This design pattern is used to clearly separate the server part, where the database requests will be processed, the logic of data transfer and interaction, and the client part, which allows you to consider each part as a separate object and freely modify it if necessary. It is very convenient to develop a project in MS Visual Studio because there is already this template for development there, and it will also allow you to use the quite popular and not the most complicated programming language C#. The Angular[4] framework is recommended for the frontend. It will allow you to easily create a web page adapted for both desktop and mobile display. The ""modularity"" of the framework will also be very useful, where each page and pop-up window are separate objects, due to which the application is developed and easily modified block by block. These blocks themselves are also divided into different elements, namely HTML, CSS and TypeScript. For the interaction between the database and the web application, you should use API methods that are prescribed in the server part. There are two ways to fill such a monitoring system: manual, which can be rare, inaccurate and not to the owner's liking, and automatic. Since the presence of devices from different manufacturers is allowed, a library should be created to collect data from the devices of the most popular manufacturers with the possibility of individual modification. It is also possible to create a bot that would collect this data instead of a person, with the possibility that the owner must first show how to collect data from a new device, and then the bot will do it itself. house/.

26,Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Forecasting Bankruptcy of Enterprises,84,"Liashenko O., Kravets T., Kostovetskyi Ye."," Abstract. The use of various machine learning algorithms for the task of forecasting the company's bankruptcy based on financial indicators is studied. Different approaches to the formation of the data set on which the models are trained are compared, in particular, data balancing methods. It is shown that models trained on small training data sets cope best with the classification of the company into the ""bankruptcy"" class, i.e. methods of artificial reproduction of data are ineffective for such tasks. Keywords: bankruptcy forecasting, machine learning, data balancing, binary classification Bankruptcy is the final stage of the crisis state of the enterprise, which is characterized by the fixation of negative results of financial and economic activity, starting from the temporary inability to pay a monetary obligation to a full-fledged stable inability to pay debts. The crisis situation of the enterprise can be caused by external and internal factors. External factors are objective in relation to the bankrupt enterprise. They do not directly depend on the actions of the enterprise and cannot be prevented or controlled. The internal causes of bankruptcy are determined by problems within the company itself, they are subjective for the enterprise, and if they are detected in time, they can be solved in order to avoid a crisis [1]. Under the conditions of increasing economic instability in the world, the urgency of the problem of the financial crisis is increasing both at the global and national levels, and at the level of a specific enterprise. Companies, especially small ones, always have a hard time surviving crisis situations and are often unable to remain solvent after a crisis occurs at the company, as a result of which most of them are forced to file for bankruptcy. In the context of constant economic instability in the world and the constant increase in the number of bankruptcies in America, companies, in particular American ones, need to implement methods of financial monitoring and predicting bankruptcy [2]. The purpose of this work is to compare different machine learning algorithms for predicting the bankruptcy of an enterprise for a certain period of time based on a set of financial indicators of the company. To achieve this goal, the tasks were set: to determine the features of bankruptcy forecasting using machine learning methods; to analyze various machine learning algorithms for the tasks of classifying bankrupts; apply data balancing methods; choose a system of indicators to assess the accuracy of classification; to compare machine learning algorithms and data balancing methods based on selected accuracy metrics. Research methods - 9 machine learning algorithms (bootstrap aggregation, support vector machines with a linear and radial basis kernel, artificial neural networks, random forest, boosting algorithm, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, decision trees and logistic regression), as well as 5 methods data balancing (Random over-sampling, SMOTE, ADASYN, Random under-sampling and Near- Miss). The models were built based on the data of American companies that officially declared themselves bankrupt in the period from 1980 to 2014 and about which there is financial information for at least two years before the registration of bankruptcy, as well as firms that did not go bankrupt during this period. The set consists of 69,290 observations of companies, of which 557 are bankrupt, and 68,733 have not filed bankruptcy for the specified period [3]. As a result of the research, it was established that artificial neural networks, as well as algorithms whose classifiers are based on the principle of building decision trees - bootstrap aggregation, random forest, and decision tree algorithm turned out to be the best for the task of predicting bankruptcy. The results of training on a balanced training set were compared, as well as the results of training models on data to which Random over-sampling, SMOTE, ADASYN, Random under-sampling and Near-Miss methods were applied. Based on the obtained comparison results, it can be concluded that, given the above-described features of the structure of financial data, it is not appropriate to use large training sets, and therefore data multiplication methods (Random over-sampling, SMOTE and ADASYN) are not optimal options for bankruptcy classification. With an extremely large difference in the number of instances of the ""bankrupt"" and ""non-bankrupt"" classes, artificial data propagation algorithms are not able to clearly separate the two classes, and therefore effectively replicate the structure of examples of the minority class. This leads to the fact that the model trained on such data misclassifies most of the bankrupts, which is not practically acceptable. On the other hand, in cases where the training set was quite small, i.e. with balanced data or when Random under-sampling or Near-Miss was used for balancing, the models could more accurately distinguish between instances of different classes when classifying test data.

27,The Method of Detecting Deviations in the Nature of Traffic from the Elements of the Information Communication Network,86,"Lukova-Chuiko N., Toliupa S., Laptieva T., Laptiev S."," Abstract. A method of providing operational traffic analysis is proposed in order to provide information about suspicious situations that require further detailed analysis. The developed method makes it possible to inform responsible specialists in real time about deviations in the nature of traffic. Deviations measured from the normal traffic of the telephone network. This method has a methodology that takes into account practical recommendations for constant coefficients for calculations. Keywords: method, traffic deviation, calculation coefficients, primary data. INTRODUCTION According According to the latest research by the World Telecommunication Network Disruption Association (CFCA), in 2021, losses from breaches in the telecommunications industry amounted to 90-119 billion. This is about 67% more than the figure obtained in CFCA research three years ago [1]. Violations on telecommunication networks are the actions of subscribers, telecommunications operators or third parties aimed at obtaining telecommunication services at a reduced rate or without payment. Experts count about 200 types of violations in telecommunication networks. The most common violations by subscribers are the connection of third parties to the subscriber's line in order to receive free telematics services. Conducting long-term international talks, organization of unauthorized negotiation points [2]. The use of hardware and software to receive international traffic from the Internet and pass it over a public telecommunications network undercover is a third-party violation. On the part of operators, the most common is the unauthorized termination of incoming long-distance and international traffic to the public network under the guise of local, without appropriate contracts. Abuses lead to loss of revenue, subscriber complaints and disruptions in telecommunications networks. The fight against misuse of telecommunications networks is largely based on the analysis of data about services and data contained in payment systems with subscribers and operators [3]. Detection of suspicious actions of subscribers and their analysis is the main principle of modern fraud protection systems - Fraud Management System, FMS. The key criteria for the effectiveness of the Fraud Management System are the speed of work and the flexibility of debugging algorithms. This provides incident detection and analysis, as well as standardized interfaces for integration with billing platforms and customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Formulation of the problem Based on the analysis of modern literature and scientific research, it is possible to conclude that there are no universal devices or software that would ensure fast implementation of traffic analysis and information transfer by automated systems or relevant specialists. Therefore, developing a method that can provide the quick performance of traffic analysis and information about suspicious situations that require further detailed investigation is relevant and very important. The material and methods The operation of violation detection mechanisms is based on the processing of records of network-registered CDR events (Call Detail Record). The anti-fraud system looks for non-compliance with certain conditions or non-compliance with a given pattern, the characteristics of the subscriber's behavior. When the detection module finds one of the anomalies, it generates a warning message. Typical conditional checks for FMS systems include: Non-existent numbering (calling party number «A») Verification of authorization, temporary blocking of number «A» Correspondence to the set template Checking the «black and white lists» Frequently repeated subscriber numbers «A» or «B» Check the connection duration Verification of suspicious calls from «A» subscribers for inclusion in the list of «B» subscribers who most often receive calls from abroad. Changes in the intensity of signal and information load. The search for a given template is based on traffic patterns that are created for each telecommunications operator. The difference between the existing signal and information traffic and the template indicates a possible violation. An additional use of templates is to compile a profile of the subscriber (telecommunications operator) of the attacker and search for compliance with such a profile among existing subscribers (telecommunications operators). Profiles can contain such characteristics as: activity during the day; activity in the evening; activity at night; volumes of outgoing traffic to mobile phones; volumes of outgoing traffic to fixed local numbers (including frequently used numbers); volumes of outgoing traffic to fixed numbers in other cities (including frequently used numbers); volumes of outgoing traffic to fixed numbers in other countries (including frequently used numbers); number range of the operator; average number of connections over time; average amount of traffic over time; average connection duration; number of unique numbers; characteristic directions. The most critical for the Customer in terms of reducing revenue loss are: violation of the routing of long-distance and international calls, detection of subscriber numbers on outgoing local traffic, activity of operators on incoming local traffic, similar to the operation of gateways to complete incoming long-distance and international traffic in the activity of subscriber numbers, which may be evidence of third-party connection to the subscriber line or actions of the subscriber that potentially lead to complaints, non-payment for services and debt write-off. Automated analysis of data on services must be operational. Thus, at this stage it is important to develop a method designed to analyze traffic and inform about situations that are suspicious and require further detailed analysis by automated systems or relevant specialists. The main tasks in developing the method will be: Debugging the elements of the telecommunications network. Automatic or with the participation of the operator Providing automatic analysis, data classification, search for deviations of behavior of elements of a telecommunication network from a usual profile. Creation of an detection algorithm based on the features of violations that create a dynamic over time impact on the network, causing anomalous phenomena. Development of a graphical display of changes in quantitative characteristics over a period of time. Estimation of conformity of parameters of anomalies (non-existent number, big duration of a call, etc.) to the values characteristic of this type. Assessment of anomalies on the degree of probability of violation to determine the priority of response. Development of information on the detection of deviations and events. Development of a user-friendly operator interface. Block detection scheme, which is based on the characteristics of violations, it is possible to present in Figure 1. Figure.1- Block diagram of detection of estimates of profile anomalies for detection of violations CONCLUSIONS The analysis showed the absence of scientific and methodological apparatus, universal devices or automated software packages to ensure the rapid implementation of traffic analysis and information transfer to automated systems or relevant specialists. Therefore, a method has been developed to ensure the prompt implementation of traffic analysis and information about situations that are suspicious and require further detailed analysis by automated systems or relevant specialists. The developed method allows to carry out operative (real-time) informing of responsible specialists, or transfer of necessary data to the automated complex, about deviation of character of traffic from network elements (separate telephone numbers, number capacities, trunk groups, etc.) which is fixed in primary data. Deviations, the nature of traffic from the elements of network parameters are measured from the usual traffic of the telephone network relative to these elements. The given technique takes into account practical recommendations concerning constant coefficients, calculations. These coefficients are selected by calculation and empirical. This reduces the response of the System using the developed method to the deviation of the communication parameters by 9% compared to existing methods. This is a perfectly acceptable result.

28,Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in the Program for Identifying a Means of Personal Protection in the Image of a Person's Face,90,"Merkulova K., Ivanenko I."," Abstract. At this time, human civilization must quickly adapt to the impending threat. Although wearing a mask is not a permanent solution, it does reduce the rate of transmission of the virus. Creating such a safe ecosystem requires mask detection techniques to ensure that transmission rates are kept to a minimum in crowded public spaces and other places where the risk of transmission is high. Throughout its development, humanity has always sought to automate as many of its life processes as possible, since such an approach frees the person from unnecessary actions and work, and also increases labor productivity. It is not surprising that automation has reached such a process as detecting people without medical masks in public and public places. Thus, solving the problem of medical mask detection is an important aspect of security and control during a pandemic. Keywords: face detection, medical mask, artificial neural network, CNN, viola- jones method, oriented gradient histogram, comparative analysis. The main function of the developed software is the detection of personal protective equipment on the image of a person's face. The task can be conditionally divided into two tasks: Detection of a person's face on the input image (Face Detection) is finding the pixel coordinates of the license plate on the image. Detection of personal protective equipment on a localized face of a person (Mask Recognition) - assignment of the input image to one of the classes (a person in a mask, without a mask, in an incorrectly worn mask). First of all, it is necessary to understand exactly how we will localize a person's face in this image. Today, such a task in the field of computer vision is known as ""Face Detection"". It is far from new, so it is not surprising that there are dozens of different methods and technologies that differ primarily in the quality of the final result. Therefore, among the most popular solutions to the ""Face Detection"" problem, it is necessary to determine the most relevant solution according to the developed quality criteria: 	𝐼𝑜𝑈 ∑𝑁 =	𝑖=1 𝐼𝑜𝑈𝑖 - Intersection over Union. This criterion evaluates the 𝑐	𝑁 accuracy with which the face detector localizes the face in the image. ∑𝑁 𝑇 =	𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑇𝑖 - average face localization time. This criterion is intended to demonstrate the speed of face recognition by the detector. 𝑅 = 𝑁 𝑖=1 ∑𝑁 𝑚𝑖 𝑘𝑖 - the ratio of the number of correctly localized faces to the 𝑖=1 number of all faces. This criterion evaluates such a quantitative characteristic of the face detector as the ability to recognize faces. To date, there is no exact analytical solution to the problem of image detection or recognition, which complicates the development of a universal algorithm. Nevertheless, in order to endow computer systems with the possibility of a kind of ""sight"", a large number of methods and algorithms have been created and proposed. Based on my own experience and various articles on the Internet, the following most popular and used methods for detecting objects in the image were chosen: The Viola-Jones method - the advantages of this method can be considered a high speed of operation and a percentage of the probability of correctly detecting the object in the image. Thus, this method can be applied in many fields of activity, for example, to detect the recognition of license plates on cars (for further analysis) or in our case, to detect faces in an image [1]. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) – this method is based on counting the number of gradient directions in local areas of the image [2]. As a result of the study of the above detection methods in the context of the proposed quality criteria, the following results were obtained: if a detection method based on a histogram of oriented gradients is used for the task of localization of a human face in an image, then a gain in localization frequency by 10% and localization accuracy by 11% is observed , instead, we lose in the time spent on localization, which is as much as 6 times greater, compared to the Viola-Jones method. The quality criteria, on the basis of which the comparative analysis was carried out, was calculated with an error of the order of 10e-5. Thus, based on the obtained results, it can be said that each of the considered detection methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. The description of the Mask Recognition task can be presented as follows: the image of a localized human face acts as input data, and as output data it is necessary to determine which of the three classes the current image belongs to: there is no medical mask on the face; a medical mask is present and correctly worn on the face; a medical mask is present and is not properly worn on the face. Today, similar problems of image classification are very often solved with the help of so-called artificial neural networks, because in this direction they show very good results compared to other technologies. At this stage, we decided on the technology that will be used to solve the problem of Mask Recognition. This technology does not stand still and has begun to develop at a particularly fast pace in recent decades. That is why, today, there are various architectures of artificial neural networks, each of which is designed to a greater extent to solve its specialized problems. In our case, the so-called convolutional neural network (CNN) proved to be the best for the task of image classification. Various modifications were developed on the basis of convolutional neural networks. Within this section, such modifications as: ResNet - the winner of the ImageNet competition in 2015, contains more than 150 layers and scored 96.43% accuracy. EfficientNet is one of the most modern CNNs, presented by Google in 2019 [3]. Thus, we have three possible ways of solving the “Mask Recognition” problem, namely using one of the following artificial neural networks: Normal CNN, ResNet and EfficientNet. For each of them, its own structure was developed, which after training gives the best results, based on the results of the conducted experiments. The comparison of the results of network training was carried out according to the quality criterion ""test accuracy"" (the percentage of correctly classified images for the test sample), since this metric is the most objective, since the test sample of images does not take any part in the training of neural networks. According to the obtained results, a neural network based on EfficientNet performed best for solving the given problem, as its classification accuracy on the test sample was 99.21% - this result is the best among trained neural networks. The neural network based on EfficientNet performed better on the test sample than the network based on ResNet by 1.48%, and by 11.86% than the conventional convolutional network. As a result of the conducted research, a software architecture was developed, on the basis of which the final software product was developed, which, as a result of the testing, showed excellent results, which were predicted even at the stage of research of detection methods and methods of image classification.

29,The Strategy of the Management of ZVO Based on Neuro-Fuzzy Models,93,"Merkulova K., Lybak I."," Abstract. Formation of the management strategy of a higher education institution (HEI) is an extremely urgent issue in modern realities. It is the construction and effective use of the higher education management strategy that will enable a quick response to dynamic changes in modern conditions, as well as significantly increase the competitiveness of the higher education institution in the market of educational services. Ways to solve this problem can be mathematical methods and models of fuzzy logic. Keywords: higher education institution, neuro-fuzzy models, fuzzy logic, management strategy, concurrency, market of educational services. One of the most important problems of the development of society is the development of education. Today, the educational environment is undergoing a global transformation due to internationalization, globalization of the world economy and modern challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the full-scale invasion of the territory of Ukraine. The increase in society's demands for the quality of education, changes in the organizational and economic conditions of higher education institutions, the implementation of higher education in the European educational space and the related process of updating technologies and standards of education as a whole have led to intensified competition not only in the domestic market of educational services , but also abroad. In modern conditions, the formation and application of an effective management strategy of a higher education institution is an important factor not only for existence, but also for ensuring its competitiveness in the market of educational services and the labor market [1, 2]. In addition, the implementation of this task can solve a number of issues, namely, the identification of new and strengthening of existing strengths of higher education institutions, their flexible response to unforeseen situations, in particular, the forced transition to mixed or distance education [3]. Ways to solve this problem can be mathematical methods and models of fuzzy logic [4]. Today, the main ""consumers"" of fuzzy calculations on the Ukrainian market are bankers and financiers, as well as specialists in the field of political and economic analysis. They use fuzzy calculations to create models of various economic, political, stock exchange situations. The use of neuro-fuzzy models in the formation of a management strategy is caused primarily by the existence of the ESS in conditions of inaccuracy and uncertainty, as well as in the application of expert knowledge formulated in a linguistic form. After all, it is believed that fuzzy logic arose as the most convenient way to build control systems for complex technological processes, and only later found wide use in various types of computer analytical systems. An important element of fuzzy logic is the concept of fuzzy and linguistic variables, which is used when describing objects and phenomena with the help of a fuzzy set [4]. The main advantages of fuzzy logic in comparison with other technologies of intellectual analysis are that with the same volumes of input and output information, the central decision-making unit becomes easier for human perception, and also, the solution to the complex and cumbersome task of calculating precise actions is replaced by a simpler and a flexible strategy of adaptive adjustment, maintaining the necessary accuracy of the result. It is the ability to make correct decisions in conditions of incomplete and unclear information that is the most significant property of human intelligence. Therefore, the construction of models that are close to human thinking and their use in computer systems is one of the most important scientific problems. In particular, the use of fuzzy calculations achieves significant results in strategic planning, that is, they can be used to describe the state of the educational services market, the competitiveness of higher education institutions, to assess its strengths and weaknesses, and to analyze the comprehensive state of a higher education institution.

30,Application of Fuzzy Mathematics in the Tensor Basis,95,Minaeva Ju.," The modern level of uncertainty processing is characterized by the wide implementation of intelligent systems and technologies. These systems can essentially perform symbolic processing or operations that preserve a logical conclusion. Ultimately, information can be processed heuristically, according to well-represented procedures that may require other types of languages. Due to theory, defined in [1], it is assumed the priority of informational characteristics of the phenomenon of uncertainty. Uncertainty calculus, theory, or usage method that allows describing this phenomenon should obviously be compatible with the characteristics of the phenomenon, i.e. without requiring information on a higher level than intended, without making any axiomatic assumptions about the causes of uncertainty, etc., which is not satisfied by the real situation [1]. This clearly contradicts the point of view that, for example, any uncertainty can be modeled by possibility theory, fuzzy set theory or any other unified method. Most of the existing theories and methods for modeling uncertainty are focused on specific ""types of uncertainty"" defined by their causes, or they at least imply certain causes, they also require specific types or qualities of information depending on the type of information process used. Uncertainty acquires special features in the case of BIG DATA processing. If ""standard uncertainty"" is mostly a situation of lack of computer-readable data, therefore for BIG DATA we have a complete redundancy, in which the human mind is not able to find relevant and valuable information in the arrays of available data. Obviously, there is an increased need to reduce the complexity of data compression. This is the reason for the growing importance of (intelligent) data, including methods and tools. Web technology opens completely new fields of application. The most important conclusion of [1] is that all defined cases, in which the Fuzzy Set Theory is correctly used as a modeling tool. These cases are characterized by the following features: Fuzzy phenomena, relationships, or assessments are modeled by well-defined and grounded theories. The best approximation of real phenomena by formal models is achieved by using the Fuzzy Set Theory (FST) apparatus. The task requirements are such that dichotomous modeling cannot guarantee to obtain fundamentally new information, the real phenomenon normally requires more detailed information, typical to the human mentality. The amount of computer-readable data is too large to be understood by a human observer. One cannot agree with these conclusions 100%, moreover, there are no criteria for the correctness of the selection of fuzzy models (which, by the way, forces the use of model variability), but as a working tool, they are suitable for use. Recall that a fuzzy set 𝐴̃ in some (non-empty) space𝑋, 𝐴̃ ⊆ 𝑋 is a subset of ordered pairs  𝐴̃ = (𝑥, 𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥)), 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋, 𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥) [0,1] - the membership function of the fuzzy set, which assigns to each element the degree of its belonging to the fuzzy set (FS), while 𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥)=1 means the full membership of the element x to the fuzzy set A, i.e.; x  A; 𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥)=0 means that the element does not belong to the fuzzy set, i.e. 𝑥 ∉ 𝐴̃; 0 ≤ 𝜇𝐴̃(𝑥) ≤ 1; means the partial membership of the element x to the fuzzy set 𝐴̃. 𝑋 = {𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛} - the universal set on which the membership function (MF) is formed, it is often given in the form of an interval 𝑋 = [𝑥min, 𝑥max]. MF models the person’s mental ability to give an appropriate assessment of certain phenomena, based on hidden knowledge, conditioned by the common sense inherent in a person, experience and, as a rule, is assigned by an expert. Note that, in general, the universal set (US) can be determined only based on a subset of the initial data, which may be distorted, have missing data, inaccurate or ambiguous data, etc., which makes it difficult to objectively determine the US, but this circumstance is practically ignored when forming the FS [2]. The concept of a tensor variable in the context of fuzzy sets was introduced in [3]. In the context of this work, the author uses the representation of FS in the form of a matrix with dimension n2 𝑥̃ ≜ {𝑥⁄𝜇𝑥} 𝑥1  𝜇 𝑥1 𝑥	𝜇 𝑥2 = (	⋮	) = 𝑥𝑛 𝜇 𝑥𝑛 𝑥1  𝜇 𝑥1 ; 𝑥2  𝜇 𝑥2 ; ⋯ 𝑥𝑛	𝜇 𝑥𝑛), 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋, 𝜇𝑥 → [0,1].	(1) In Matlab notation, each component of the n2 - matrix representation of FS 𝑥̃ has the form: 𝑥̃ (:,1)= [𝑥1 𝑥2 ⋯ 𝑥𝑛]𝑇, 𝑥̃ (:,2)= [𝜇 𝑥1 𝜇 𝑥2 ⋯ 𝜇 𝑥𝑛]𝑇respectively, x = x (:,1) x (:,2), tensor model of FS in Matlab notation can be represented as a tensor variable , where  is the symbol of the tensor (Kroneker) product. The procedure of singular tensor-variable decomposition of which	(u s v)=svd( x T ) allows to obtain a new subset of ordered pairs -	, moreover, x,  x is	the	closest	(in	the	sense	of	the	F-norm)	to	x	x/ x ,	,	i.e. xvx F  min, xnx F  min,, takes place def  nx  def  x  def vx. The tensor model of FS allows to significantly expand the set of standard operations on FS due to the Kronecker product [4] (detection and consideration of new uncertainty properties), in particular, the solution of fuzzy equations at the level of standard matrix equations Conclusions: The expediency of using hidden knowledge, presented in the FS structure, is shown, which consists in the fact that based on the singular decomposition of Toeplitz (or Hankel) matrices formed on a universal set, it is possible to form subsets of ordered pairs or sequences that can be used as analogs of membership functions. A new method of forming subsets of ordered pairs with FS properties is proposed, which does not require heuristic assignment of MF. It is shown that in several cases, the application of the FS formed by using a heuristically assigned MF, and the subset of ordered pairs calculated by using the fuzzy models in the form of Toeplitz matrices give close or coincident results in case of solving problems of fuzzy mathematics.

31,Project Management During the Automation of Business Processes of Companies,98,"Mishchenko D., Yeremenko B."," In the conditions of an increase in the scale and complexity of projects, the number of participants and organizations, the growth of requirements for the terms of implementation, the use of financial, material and labor resources, the only universal approach is project management. Project management has such key advantages as direction to achieve set goals, as well as a focus on communication and management of stakeholder expectations, which can increase their satisfaction. These advantages allow economic entities to make decisions faster and better and bring new goods and services to the market [1]. Each actively developing enterprise seeks to increase its competitive advantages by creating a new product, service or introducing fundamentally new processes in its activities. Currently, there are two main directions in the development of project management. Normative project management is a well-structured management model suitable for bureaucratic systems. The second direction is a creative-reflexive model, which is designed to manage dynamic and changeable projects in conditions of a high level of uncertainty in the external environment. In practice, the most widely used design methods are Agile and Waterfall [1]. However, despite the fact that the presented methods of project management demonstrate clear advantages, at present, experts note an insufficiently high level of effectiveness	of	the	application	of	the	project	approach.	So,	for	example, PricewaterhouseCoopers research conducted on more than 10,640 projects showed that only 2.5% of companies complete their projects 100% successfully. The main problems causing failure to achieve the goals of projects are related to non-compliance with the deadlines or budget of the project, and failure to complete assigned tasks [4]. In order to manage digitalization projects in the field of innovation, given the complexity, complexity and novelty of both the projects themselves and the environment in which they are implemented, a variant of the project approach is required that will satisfy both the needs of the general trend of digitalization and the specifics of innovation. expressed in uncertainty, high risks, and a negative response to the transformations being made by project participants. In this regard, a new, adapted, approach to the management and implementation of digitalization projects of innovative activity, based on the advantages of Agile and Waterfall methods, should now be implemented. We propose the development of existing approaches by forming an adapted approach that includes elements of Agile and Waterfall methods projected onto an information platform and a risk management system, which in synergy will determine the creation of the necessary basis for effective planning and implementation of digitalization projects in the innovative sphere of domestic enterprises. The concept of this method is based on the focus on achieving results within the established time and budget limits, subject to the timely leveling of the influence of risk factors due to high uncertainty, the possibility of which is determined by integration during execution with an information system that permeates all stages of the digitalization project. The concept of a project approach based on an adapted method includes the following main elements: Project management methodology is based on the synergy of Agile and Waterfall methods, but the main goal is set on the process of the improvement approach to standardize common project management procedures including resource, risk, and quality management (CMMI). The applied project management tools are based on modern information technologies and engineering, modern means of collecting and processing management information on ongoing digitalization projects. Samples of these tools can be the combination of Azure DevOps and MS Project during the project implementation. At the same time, the most important principle of the adapted method is the principle of information security, compliance with which is achieved by creating the necessary information contour, the elements of which permeate all the structural components of the digitalization project. Firstly, it allows you to effectively plan the project, and secondly, it provides the monitoring system with the necessary information. Thirdly, it contributes to the effective interaction of all project participants. And, finally, it has a certain leveling effect on resistance to change, since the use of information technology is part of the digitalization process.

32,Mental Health Mobile Application Development: How to Manage a Project to Turn Value into Profit,100,"Morozov V., Kubiavka L., Synelnyk K."," Abstract. About one billion people globally experience mental illnesses in different forms, reported the United Nations in 2022 [1]. While more people understand how crucial it is to maintain psychological well-being, many still do not address their concerns to specialists for a variety of reasons. Fortunately, in the era of digital solutions we have numerous mental health mobile applications which can help us to maintain overall mental health condition. Developing such apps might be a promising idea, which can not only provide benefit to users, but also bring income to creators. Keywords: mental health, psychological wellbeing, mobile application, development, making a profit, project management. Stephen Schueller, PhD, executive director of One Mind PsyberGuide, a nonprofit organization that offers accurate information about mental health mobile applications, evaluates its number between 10,000 and 20,000 these days [2]. In addition, the Medgadget predicts there will be up to 50,000 similar online services by 2025 (Figure 1) [3]. Figure 1 - Projected number of mental health mobile applications in 2018 - 2025 Unfortunately, a lot of products are developed by small teams that do not involve professionals in creating relevant functionalities and content which should help users overcome their psychological disorders. It is obvious that any possible mental health mobile application cannot substitute treatment sessions with a psychologist/psychotherapist or medication, but at least they can help to improve quality of sleep, teach how to meditate and breath, track mood, make users happier, increase productivity, reduce anxiety and depression etc. The market for mental health apps is growing. Recently, Global View Research studied that a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) will be expanded up by 16.5% from 2022 to 2030 [4]. They believe an increasing awareness of mental health as well as people lifestyle will be main reasons of the market expansion. In 2018, the top ten mental health digital solutions gained $15 million in the U.S. alone and $27 million worldwide [5]. They used the following monetization strategies: Subscriptions. The technique allows users to gain access to premium content by renewing their subscriptions weekly, monthly, or yearly. Freemium. It is also possible to let users access an application for free to view some content and do certain activities, however any other meaningful content should be paid separately. In-app advertising. Advertising banners can generate income, however it has small margin. Also, it is necessary to display materials that will be relevant to users. Analysis of available applications in App Store or Google play shows that successful products mostly stick with subscription payments, as people used to pay regularly to get what they want in full volume. Even Apple noted that the subscription revenue strategy makes more money for applications, comparing with other techniques. Nevertheless, One Mind PsyberGuide says, while the number of available mental wellbeing apps increases, user engagement remains low. To succeed, creators should consider developing a solution relevant to their end user instead of setting higher prices or getting more subscribes. While stages for developing a mental health mobile application are similar when comparing with general applications, there are two aspects which should be considered when managing the project: Conduct product discovery. There are plenty of psychological disorders, so you need to have a clear vision which exact problems you wish to solve. It is also crucial to understand your target audience, as, for example, teenagers and the elderly have different concerns. Build a strong team. To develop a successful mobile application, that will help people and not harm them, hiring specialized professionals is a must. They will help to find out what problems people experience, and which activities are more effective. In general, if you manage a mental health mobile application development project, you should follow the next steps: idea validation, market research, preparing a list of app requirements, building a project team, involving specialists in the mental health field, designing, developing, testing, and releasing the app (the Figure 2). Figure 2 – Mental health app development from idea to launch in 8 steps To sum up, developing a mental health mobile application is a very responsible project as it should assist people with making their lives better. If a project team considers all aspects to make the application outstanding, more people will be getting mental wellbeing improved while creators could receive significant recognition and income.

33,Evaluation of Cognitive Biases in Brain-Computer Interfaces,103,Mykhalchuk V.," Abstract. Decision making is faced with the influence of cognitive biases. Minimizing the action of such factors allows you to optimize workflows and increase performance efficiency. To achieve this goal, special strategies can be developed in smart environments equipped with a BCI-mode. Methodology. Human-machine interaction involves the combination of several components. Therefore, the development of technologies takes place along the lines of improving hardware and software and the development of human neuroplasticity, increasing the level of brain-computer literacy. Much attention is paid to the issue of quality development of brain-computer interfaces in such fundamental works as ""Fundamentals of BCI"" by A. Nijholt, ""Clocking the mind"" (Jensen A. R.), ""Toward Brain-Computer Interfacing"" (Dornhege, G.) [1, 2, 3]. An important research method eis multi-level analysis in system design. One of the newest research projects directed in the most near about this topic is “Cognitive Stress Classification” (Blanco J., 2019) [5]. Results. The research is conducted in an environment with a brain-computer interface. A smart component is the testing system covering the field of professional knowledge created on the basis of a bank of tasks. Each task and answer options are stimuli offered to the student. The test participant trains his own reaction to these stimuli. According to our research [6] mental activity in efficient network represented by cognemes of idiolect compared with “typical” jargon. In actual research such approach combined with evaluation of cognitive biases influence in working process. With such aim working process presented as flow of tasks and decisions. Performance prospective can be represented in correlation of indicators such as efficiency (accuracy and reaction time) and its mental view. Each task is stimuli with own degree of complexity, which may be described by type of object (code, algorithm, decision etc.), typical reaction time, cognemical view, accuracy distribution for these conditions, answer array or tree, and evaluated into this representation. Cognitive biases [4] can be described by type (motivational, performance, memory, and perception), intense (difference between normal reaction time and performed in the study), coordinate in perfomogramme (timed event-related position in the performance matrix correlated with decision making). Fixation of performance metrics includes EEG analysis by data correlation of ideal and current with biases marked. For the 7’30-10’20 cut of 15 minutes routine of debugging the cognitive biases influence have presented on the Fig. 1 correlation matrix. Figure 1 – Cognitive biases evaluation by Pearson criteria (correlation matrix). Results by study of 15 attempts through previous BCI illiteracy diagnosis (1-4th – Stroop color test, navigation 8 sec. training and 2’30-5 min transformation with spontaneous decisions and reactions), individual training session in routine 15 min tasks (5-11th) with different performance condition (usual, stressed and spontaneous workload), mindfulness (13th - meditation) and correctional training (14-15th - ideal performance) Conclusion. Implementation of cognitive technology on the model of advanced companies in educational activities allows students to develop the skills of effective adaptation to modern working conditions and increases the efficiency of training. Expanding the power of research (complex tests, several stages of processing results, adaptation of test programs to the curriculum studies system) will be the stage of mastering neuroplasticity as a new type of competence.

34,Brain-Computer Interfaces and Education,105,"Mykhalchuk V., Kuchansky A."," Abstract. One of the achievements of modern society is the brain-computer interface (BCI) as a way to organize an intelligent environment. Such systems have already been successfully implemented and contribute to integrating people with disabilities into society, overcoming disorders, diagnosis, and monitoring well-being. Studying mental activity in business interaction, training, consumer activity, and entertainment is becoming increasingly popular. The study of the peculiarities of the functioning of human consciousness contributes to the successful integration of brain- computer interfaces into modern technologies of information systems such as invisible computing. Keywords: brain-computer interfacing, e-society, connectivity. The study of the peculiarities of the functioning of human consciousness contributes to the successful integration of brain-computer interfaces into modern technologies of information systems such as invisible computing. The article highlights the latest trends in the development and implementation of neuro-computer interfaces with the principles of the organization of e-society and the problems and prospects that arise in the conditions of its evolution. The analysis was carried out based on the research of real successfully implemented projects, and the experience of participation in conferences was applied. Possible actual implementations are described, and examples have already been implemented. Particular attention is paid to the issue of neuro-computer inequality and its solution, which is one of the main detachable issues that have been updated in recent years. The implementation of neuro-computer interfaces in combination with popular trends and technologies such as post-quantum programming, consciousness uploading, cloud, and fog computing, and enter civilization communication are investigated. The nearest electronic society stage (2035-2050) based on Z and α generations will acquire critical skills in the mental management of intelligent environments, increasing the efficiency of information systems of any complexity and purpose. The first steps to this point of development that have already been done are the legalization of BCI technology and mass user implementation, which continue to be investigated along with the rapid growth of generation and the performance of new ideas following the latest opportunities and conditions. Brain-computer became more popular and developed their comprehensive improvement for different spheres of human activity in various technological decisions and specializations. Today we have a range of successfully used projects such as assistive and for typical users. Technology includes consumer, education, business, navigation, fashion, health monitoring, emotion control, etc. Shared experience and the number of equipment realize the opportunity to raise a BCI community at the nearest time. The 2015 BNCI society report showed significant growth in customer activity in 2011 when in comparison with the previous year, 4 million devices were sold. Also, this report presented an essential and large volume of prognosis for the nearest paths of BCI development: increasing hybrid functional use in 2025; the rising number of devices for non-medical use by 2035; the growing BCI society by 2045. The technology overcame a range of problems by 1980-1990, and the main achievement of implementation in 2008-2011 is a trend of wireless devices available for everyday use for mood monitoring, health care, input and administration, business, etc. [1]. Mental commands are accessible for interfacing with any task, and an open software development policy improves the efficiency of the exchange of ideas and practices of its implementation. The comprehensive development of BCI at the intersection of many trends in information technology forces us to evaluate the next steps in technology development and outline the likely directions and solutions for wide implementations. It is also worth noting the new challenges and problems of using such technologies in the predicted conditions. The most significant interest lies in the fascination of the next 20-30 years, and the progress of development technologies and approaches to system design influences the conditions. No less critical factors will be the co-alignment in the labor market of different generations and the difference in the ability to use such tools. Neuro-computer interfaces are becoming a standard technology in modern society. Careful regulation of implementation standards and different quality of developer products, availability, and ease of use indicate readiness for widespread implementation.

35,Web Application for Evaluating the Level of Criticality of Organizational System Elements,107,"Naberegniy A., Hnatiienko H."," Abstract. In today's rapidly changing world, an important aspect of ensuring the functional stability of organizational system is the stable functioning of critical elements of a system. Determining the level of influence of critical elements on the functioning of organizational systems in a quantitative form is a complex multifactorial problem. Its solution requires large labor costs, the use of special procedures and considerable time spent by specialists in various fields. The purpose of this work is to study the problem of determining the criticality of elements of organizational systems and to create a web application for structural analysis of organizational systems. Keywords: expert evaluation, organizational system, critical element, diagram, structure Introduction. The critical elements of any system are such elements, the state and functionality of the system depends on their functioning [1, 2]. It is clear that not all critical elements affect the state of the system to the same extent, and may differ from each other in the intensity of influence on the functionality of the system, i.e., the level of criticality. One of the tools for determining the level of criticality of organizational system elements is expert methods [3]. Such methods are flexible to account for ambiguity in the problem because experts have an understanding of the trends and features of the system being evaluated. The disadvantages of expert evaluation method are subjectivity of experts and evaluation criteria. For example, in the European Union, the most critical are power plants and main transport highways. In Israel, due to the dominance of the ""Symbolic significance of objects"" criterion, the most critical are museums, archives, monuments, etc. System structure. The analysis of the task made it possible to form the following list of system functions (Figure 1) for the implementation of the platform for evaluating the organizational structure in the form of a web application. They can be conditionally divided into three groups, according to three groups of users. Client services include various project management capabilities and view results. Experts can view a visualization of the structure and provide their assessment. Administrators have a variety of options for interacting with all categories of users. Figure 1. Diagram of functions of a web application for assessing the criticality of elements of organizational systems the criticality of elements based on visualization. After that, their ratings are aggregated and displayed Figure 2 shows the interaction process of users and experts with the system in IDEF0 notation. After authorization, the user creates a project and uploads data about his organization. After that, a visualization of the system is created and provided to experts and users. Experts evaluate to the client. Figure 2. Diagram of a web application for assessing the criticality of elements of organizational systems in the IDEF0 notation of the first level of decomposition Expert evaluation of the level of criticality of elements. In order to reduce the burden on each of the k experts with indices i  1,..., k, the evaluation process was divided into two rounds. At the first stage, voting is held for 10% of the most critical elements, which go to the second round. In the case of an equal number of votes, all edge votes are taken. In the second round, experts evaluate specific elements aj , j  1,..., n, by three parameters with indices l  1, 2, 3 : impact on system resources; streams that the element controls; influence on decision-making in the system. We will denote these parameters as gil , i  1,..., k, l  1, 2, 3, (1) and rate them on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is the highest level of criticality of impact. The results of this round are the levels of criticality of each element, whose integral indicator ξ j , j  1,..., n, is determined by applying linear convolution, with equal weight of all experts and parameters: 3	k ξ j   gil , j  1,..., n. (2) l 1 i1 Thus, each critical element of the system receives a reasonable indicator of the impact on the functioning of the system - the level of criticality, calculated according to formula (2) based on expert assessments (1). Database. A relational database was designed to store all the above-mentioned data (Figure 3). The customer entity includes credentials and contacts. He creates projects and enters the data of experts who will participate in it. Each expert provides evaluation results for both rounds, on the basis of which the results of the rounds are formed, connected to the project. Figure 3. Conceptual database structure for evaluating the criticality of organizational system elements in bird's foot notation Experts enter the system through an invitation link sent to an e-mail address specified by the user when creating a project. This invitation takes them to the assessment page. After that, they go to the thank you page, from where they can go only to public pages of the application. Conclusions. The analysis of the features of organizational systems and modern approaches to the task of determining the criticality of their elements showed that such a task can be effectively solved by creating an information system. The design of the information support of the information center was carried out. These diagrams can be used for further development of information software in this direction, which will facilitate and automate the process of assessing the criticality of elements of organizational systems for any direction.

36,How Blockchain Technology Can Affect the Banking Industry,111,"Nakonechnyj V., Lutsenko V."," Abstract. Everyone nowadays is aware of the value of investing in technology and the excess returns it provides. One of the trendiest technologies on the market right now is blockchain. For the first time ever, not only have investors made their fair share of investments in blockchain, but investment banks are also currently employing this technology. Keywords: card, blockchain, data exchange, online, transaction, financial institutions, cryptography, investing Blockchain technology can destroy not only the global currency market, but also the banking industry as a whole, replacing intermediaries with a reliable, limitless and transparent system that is easy to access for anyone. Blockchain can reduce the waiting time for transactions, make them cheaper, facilitate the process of access to capital, improve data security, ensure mutual fulfillment of obligations in agreements through smart contracts, as well as smoother compliance and much more. On top of that, thanks to the innovative nature of blockchain technology, the ways in which new blocks of transactions interact with each other could lead to completely new kinds of financial services. Information is kept in ""blocks"" that are connected together and are stored in a decentralized database called a blockchain. It performs extremely particular duties that set it apart from the conventional centralized database, including computing, storing, and analyzing the data contained in this database [1]. Using blockchain technology, money transfers and payments become decentralized. This has a number of implications for the financial sector [2]: Because the decentralized database is less vulnerable to data breaches, hacking, or the statistics being manipulated with, there is a decrease in fraudulent crimes and activities. This implies a more open financial system as well. Since blockchain technology relies on real-time payment executions, banks will be able to transfer payments at a faster rate. Additionally, it aids in promptly recognizing illicit activity and discovering irregularities in financial operations. Blockchain also prevents most human mistakes since data transmitted to the blockchain cannot be changed, altered, or tampered with once it has been sent. Additionally, everyone can see it. The intensity of interaction with technology grows annually. While from 2017 to 2019 the main priority was to learn blockchain in practice, in 2019 there was a shift in focus to patenting inventions. The problems faced by the Facebook and Telegram projects could play a certain role - Financial institutions are cautious, fearing regulatory risks. In addition, commercial expectations from the launched blockchain projects could not be justified. However, Financial institutions do not want to be left behind in the blockchain arms race and want to take their place in the emerging markets for blockchain solutions, which explains the increase in scientific developments and the transition to more closed formats of interaction with technology. Thus, the “blockchain revolution” continues and moves to a qualitatively new level, despite the decrease in the number of public blockchain projects. The largest financial institutions in the world continue to actively work with technology, investing both time and money in it [3]. How to ensure that transaction and wallet information is correct, complete and confidential and how to get access to your assets in conditions of anonymity: some of the issues that need to be addressed. There is a whole science of how to solve these problems - cryptography. Encryption is one of its methods. In blockchain networks, the buyer and seller of an asset confirm the transaction using cryptographic keys - special unique digital codes [4]. It is almost impossible to guess the sequence of characters of the digital code of cryptographic keys. This makes blockchain technology one of the best for financial transactions. But at the same time, there have already been cases of wallets being hacked, so it is better to connect them to the network only for the duration of transactions, and keep them offline the rest of the time.

Advances in technology have led to fundamental changes in the way financial markets work, starting with the initial stage of forming stocks and continuing through trading those stocks. Technologies have fundamentally changed the way investments are made. Financial markets today are primarily computerized, from software-based bidding to price determination and direct clearing and settlement. Computer technology has displaced manual operations and simplified functions throughout the value chain. Stock markets worldwide are using technological advances to manage and monitor transactions securely. Currently, modern trading on the stock exchange takes place without the physical contact of brokers and provides unlimited opportunities for researching market trends and buying shares. Thanks to the introduction of technology, the stock market has become more user-friendly, providing faster settlement of transactions, increased transparency, security, automated monitoring, and much more. The close connection between information technologies and financial markets is beyond doubt, as is the relevance of research into using information technologies and innovative solutions to achieve the highest results in financial markets. The purpose of this study is to review and analyze modern information technologies used in securities trading. In particular, attention is focused on tools for forecasting trends in financial markets; technological solutions to increase the financial literacy of the population, open access to the securities market regardless of the age category of the user, his professional activity, etc.; the advantages and disadvantages of online trading, the specifics of the work of online brokers, and their role in trading on financial markets; technical analysis, time series analysis, and quantum computing for trend analysis in financial markets; the use of information technologies in the derivatives market. However, despite the radical changes caused by modern information technologies in disseminating information, the impact of contemporary information technologies on the production of knowledge by market participants still needs to be studied [1]. A few decades ago, managing your finances required recording your income and expenses in a paper ledger or, more recently, manually entering information into an Excel spreadsheet. The development of technologies significantly simplified this process, and various mobile applications began. The rapid growth of mobile applications for personal finance (Personal financial management, PFM) has benefited both businesses and consumers. Wealth management applications allow them to benefit from simplified payment processes and better understand market needs and customer spending habits. Programs for managing personal finances and the stock market have a direct connection. Investment is something that a person often does only if he already has savings or temporarily free funds that can be invested without harming the financial situation. Investing in the stock market can only be done if you fully understand your current financial situation. In this case, personal finance programs play a significant role. They provide an overview and can track a person's spending, which helps you manage your budget correctly. In addition, such programs contribute to the growth of financial literacy among the population, prepare the younger generation to invest their savings in the stock market, and help them in this. The average user has 2.5 financial apps on their phone, one of which is most likely a personal finance management tool. More and more services offer the opportunity to make small investments, that is, to receive part of the shares if only one part is worth thousands of dollars, as in the case of Amazon and Booking Holdings. Investment services have become one of the leading directions in personal finance. For example, consider the popular mobile app Robinhood, which allows you to invest in stocks, ETFs, and options. The built-in functions and investment opportunities determine the effectiveness and popularity of modern mobile applications for financial management. Of course, some wealth management programs have offered investment options for some time. First, these are investment tools with the additional ability to track expenses. Robinhood's goal was not to create a program for day traders or portfolio managers but to create a program for beginners, that is, retail investors. The developers of this application claim that they make investments accessible to young people. “Most stock brokers have been around for over 30 years, their interfaces are clunky, and they target older professionals and active traders. They're not a place for novice investors, and that's one of the things we focus on. Make it accessible. To make it convenient for mobile devices"" [2]. Thus, the application teaches young people to control their daily expenses, save pocket money, and try themselves as an investor and make a small profit in the long run. Another general application is Stash, which helps users think more intelligently about where to invest, learn more about different investment options, compare them and make an appropriate decision. About 25,000 users join investment processes and stock trading every week. Analysts estimated that from January to September 2020, the number of users increased by 1 million and amounted to 6 million. The application also opened opportunities to diversify the investment portfolio, which was different from the previous application. Unlike an app like Robinhood, which until early 2020 required users to have a significant amount of cash in their account to buy shares in companies like Facebook or Amazon, Stash allowed them to invest in bundles of related stocks for as little as $5 . Instead of investing in stocks, users invest in ETFs, exchange-traded funds, or securities that rise and fall depending on the value of their underlying asset or commodity [3]. Technology has led to fundamental changes in the way financial markets work, starting from the very first stage of the formation of stocks and continuing through trading those stocks. Technology, without a doubt, has fundamentally changed the way investments are made. Financial markets today are primarily computerized – from software-based order submission to price determination and direct clearing and settlement, computer technology has displaced manual operations and simplified functions throughout the trading value chain. The emergence of modern information technologies has radically changed the way information is disseminated in financial markets, making a large amount of information available to a broad base of financial market participants in real-time at low costs. The close connection between information technologies and financial markets is beyond doubt, as well as the relevance of research into using various information technologies and innovative solutions to achieve the highest results in financial markets.

38,"Effectiveness of the Work of the Project Management Team for the Development and Implementation of Automated Technology to Solve Environmental Problems (for the ""Smart Parks"" IT Project)",116,"Nizov Ya., Latysheva T."," Abstract. The article describes an effective approach to the work of a team management on its own method ""Rings of curiosity"". Keywords: Project, smart, managing, development, parks, effective. Introduction The success of projects always depends on many factors, but there is one without which the project cannot exist at all - the team. The team can be different, divided into subgroups and have their own goals, but it must be effective, because only in this way will work in the project make sense and bring results. The IT project management team is no exception to this rule, although projects of this specification may contain flexible personnel and have the ability to work remotely more than anyone, but if there is no effective work, then the project will not reach the release stage. Therefore, I will explain what, in my opinion, depends on the effectiveness of the project management team. An example will be the imaginary IT project ""Smart Parks""[1], which should present automated technologies as a solution to the environmental problem of maintaining parks and other urban green areas. The success of this project completely affects the development of the infrastructure of the cities where this system will be implemented, so the team must do everything possible for its implementation. General rules for managing a team. Of course, the first criterion for creating effective work will be the recruitment of suitable personnel, and since the system must have not only a software part, but also a physical part with real smart technologies, the team management will distribute responsibilities according to the specifications of the participants[2]. This stage is the first step in determining whether your team will be effective or not, because the manager must establish connections between the teams of the1i software part, physical technologies and specialists in environmental studies. This will provide an opportunity to have up-to-date information on each area of the system's activity and develop the entire system at the same time. Creating synergy in this way, it is necessary to set certain goals and objectives, limiting the spread of ideas of developers. Also, the management team should specify time constraints, i.e. deadlines and control points for each division. After that, the management team itself will have to monitor the activities and the performance of tasks, so as not to create the appearance of a manager who, apart from the formation of goals and control milestones, can do nothing else. Management is also work, but the project worker must know that their managers are competent in the goals and tasks they set; and they will be able to participate in the development as an employee, if necessary. This could be called creating equality between project participants, but this is not the case, because the main goal in this case is to make the employee understand that the manager is completely confident in the tasks he has set and knows for sure that they are possible and important. Rings of curiosity. All of the above, except for the last one, of course, are general criteria[3] for forming a quality team. Then any team is effective according to these criteria. No. The above should contain the ""Three Components of Interest"" at each stage of project work, which in turn will contribute to the effective work[5] of the team of workers, which means that the management team performs its work effectively. ""Three components of interest""[Figure 1] are three interrelated factors of effective activity, or more precisely, encouragement for it. The components consist of interest (For What?), argumentativeness (Why?) and motivation (What?). First, the manager needs to determine, ""For What?"" employees on this project, their own goals and needs, after which he connects the team's various goals to the project and argues ""Why?"" everyone needs it. But motivation acts as anchor, namely ""What?"" successful completion of this project will provide each participant. Figure 1: Rings of curiosity. Conclusion. Thus, the management team being on a complex IT project, which counts specialists from different technical fields of activity, can direct, organize and encourage them, which will show the effectiveness of the method of managers who were able to interest their entire team, even in circumstances where specializations can be difficult to interact with.

39,Intelligent Risk Assessment Models in Dis Based on the Neural Network Approach,118,"Palko D., Babenko T., Myrutenko L., Bigdan A."," Abstract. The research focuses on the current trends and existing approaches to information security risk assessment in distributed information systems. It analyzes the importance of risk management in the process of ensuring information security, and also describes a core principles of intelligent security risk assessment in DIS based on the neural network approach. It also presents a comprehensive model of cyber risk assessment based on backpropagation neural network architecture and several optimization methods. Keywords: information security, information security risk, risk assessment, risk management, risk evaluation, distributed information system, neural network. With development of computer networks the security issues in distributed systems have acquired special significance. Distributed information and computing networks unite all structural divisions and branches of organizations into a single system, allow simultaneous work with distributed and centralized applications, databases, and other services, as well as connect computer systems to each other to distribute functions and share resources. Managing the cybersecurity risk assessment in distributed systems involves solving a set of problems related to functional distribution and hierarchy, a high degree of resources parallelization, and a near-complete lack of centralized management [1]. Organization of cyber security risk assessment in distributed systems is a complex task. When solving it, one has to take into account many factors and risks that can have a negative impact on the company's activities, threat confidentiality, integrity, availability of information, the quality and speed of its processing and transmission [2]. Cyber security risks should be considered as a key factor in the strategic planning of business processes [3]. According to the results of the annual ISACA`s «STATE OF CYBERSECURITY 2022: GLOBAL UPDATE ON WORKFORCE EFFORTS, RESOURCES AND CYBEROPERATIONS» global State of Cybersecurity Survey, conducted in the fourth quarter of 2021, the vast majority of respondent’s enterprises at least once a year conduct a regular assessment of information security risks (41 percent, compared with last year’s 39 percent). Enterprises face many obstacles to conducting frequent cyber risk assessments – time, lack of internal expertise, lack the right cyber tools to effectively perform an assessment or their cost. This, in turn, points to an important issue that signals the lack of sufficiently accurate and universal methods of cyber security risk assessment [4]. Classical statistical methods of risk analysis (qualitative, quantitative, or even combined) do not supply the desired result due to their imperfection and significant limitations in terms of use. An expert analysis requires a significant level of competence and extensive practical experience from the experts. On the other hand, it's time consuming and can't be applied for analysis of large raw datasets [5]. A very promising direction of research in the field of risk assessment for complex, large-scalable and distributed systems is the application of intelligent solution modeling methods based on the neural network approach [6]. Even the simplest back- propagation neural network architecture can perform live-time pattern recognition with reasonable speed (Figure 1) [7-8]. Figure 1 – Back propagation neural network architecture Neural networks are not a new concept, but only in recent years, various companies have begun to explore and understand its full potential. The absolute advantage of neural network structures is their ability to learn, self-organize and generalize, as well as the ability to solve complex tasks [9]. An important aspect of the current research is the theoretical proof of the effectiveness of the application of back-propagation neural networks in this subject area and the practical implementation of the information security risk assessment model for solving risk management problems in distributed environments that have a number of advantages compared to classical methods of risk assessment.

40,Using Screen Space Ray Marching as a Proxy Ray Tracing Algorithm for Specular Reflection Calculation,121,Pikulsky R.," Abstract. Ray tracing optimization is a relevant topic in computer graphics. This paper focuses on analyzing the possibility to use screen space ray marching as a proxy ray tracing algorithm to increase ray tracing performance in terms of execution time. The article provides improvement rate estimation based on the mathematical model and experimental results. Keywords: computer graphics, ray tracing, optimization, screen space ray marching Ray tracing is an important technique in computer graphics used for visibility determination when solving a rendering equation or its adaptations [3]. Recently, hardware ray tracing acceleration of a bounding volume hierarchy ray tracing (BVHRT) [1] has appeared in modern graphics hardware, which has greatly increased efficiency in contrast to software-implemented algorithms, so nowadays it is often used as a primary ray tracing solution for interactive graphics applications on consumer PCs. However, the ray tracing routine remains a bottleneck in typical scenarios, since even being hardware accelerated this algorithm intends heavy computations and random memory accesses. One way to optimize it is to use screen space ray marching (SSRM) [2] as a proxy algorithm. Instead of using all the information about present geometry as a data source, SSRM only uses a rendering depth buffer [5], simplifying the calculations and making memory access more plausible for the hardware, thus making SSRM much more efficient in terms of execution time and memory consumption. Unfortunately, some rays cannot be traced by this algorithm due to a lack of information in the depth buffer (it only stores surface elements that are visible to the observer, while occluded and offscreen elements are missing), so it is impossible to use it as a standalone precise ray tracing method. Nevertheless, if using it as a preliminary stage, we can avoid performing BVHRT for those rays which SSRM can provide valid results for, which may result in an overall execution time decrease on some ray tracing workloads. In this paper, the potential efficiency gain from this optimization in a specular reflection ray tracing scenario is analyzed. Let the ray tracing workload be the set of 𝑁 rays, where the i-th ray needs 𝑡𝐵𝑉𝐻 of time to be processed by BVHRT and 𝑡𝑆𝑆 of time to be processed by SSRM. Then the overall BVHRT and SSRM execution times can be defined as: 𝑇𝐵𝑉𝐻 = 𝑁𝐸(𝑡𝐵𝑉𝐻), 𝑇𝑆𝑆 = 𝑁𝐸(𝑡𝑆𝑆), where 𝐸 is an expected value. Now, assuming SSRM can provide valid results for 𝑁𝑆𝑆 rays from the set, the execution time of an optimized algorithm can be approximated as follows: 𝑇𝑂𝑃𝑇 ≈ 𝑇𝑆𝑆 + (𝑁 − 𝑁𝑆𝑆)𝐸(𝑡𝐵𝑉𝐻), and the potential improvement in execution time is going to be: 𝑇𝐵𝑉𝐻	𝑇𝐵𝑉𝐻	1 𝑋 = 𝑇𝑂𝑃𝑇 ≈ 𝑇𝑆𝑆 + (𝑁 − 𝑁𝑆𝑆)𝐸(𝑡𝐵𝑉𝐻) = 𝑁𝑆𝑆 , 1 + 𝑇𝑆𝑆  − 𝛼 𝑇𝐵𝑉𝐻 𝛼 =	. 𝑁 For a specular reflection scenario, we considered reflection ray generation from [2], which is common for modern rendering engines. For every pixel which contains a surface element that is a specular reflector, we trace the mirror-like ray according to the law of reflection. We applied both BVHRT and SSRM to this scenario and measured their execution times in different situations (Table 1-2). The average complexities for those are: 𝑇𝐵𝑉𝐻 = 𝑂(𝑁 log 𝑀), 𝑇𝑆𝑆 = 𝑂(𝑁 log(𝑊𝐻)), where 𝑀 is the number of triangles in the scene, 𝑊 and 𝐻 are screen width and height respectively. So, for SSRM we just measured execution time on different screen resolutions, while for BVHRT we measured execution time on different screen resolutions and scene sizes. The 𝛼 value remains unchanged on different resolutions but depends on scene and observer configurations in a barely predictable way. So we collected the values of 𝑁𝑆𝑆 and 𝑁 for different configurations and computed the average value of 𝛼, which turned out to be ~0.31. All the measurements were done on a PC with GeForce RTX 2080 Super graphics card. Table 1. SSRM execution time measurements. Table 2. BVHRT execution time measurements. Table 3. Estimation of the performance improvement, times. Based on all measurements above, we estimated how the improvement from the proposed modification depends on screen resolution and scene size (Table 3). As may be observed from the table, using SSRM as a proxy ray tracing algorithm appears to be a major improvement on big scenes.

41,Development of a Сonceptual Model for Sentimental Analysis Using Data Science Methods,124,"Pryidun M., Khlevna Iu."," Abstract. This work describes the importance of sentimental analysis, its application areas, its types, and the problems it faces. The work considered 3 models, on the basis of which another one was created. Keywords: Sentimental analysis, Emotional analysis. Introduction Emotions have a great influence on our life and interaction with the surrounding world. They are not just what we feel, but also a way of transmitting information, for example, our reaction to an external stimulus: the feeling of fatigue conveys information about the temperature around, the feeling of hunger - about the amount of our energy.[1] Emotions can also show our impression of a product or service, and based on them, we can make predictions about our future choices. That is why sentimental analysis is gaining even more popularity and is increasingly being expanded and used. Analysis of emotions is the process of identifying a certain emotion that was embedded in the writing of the text or its verbal interpretation. Sentiment analysis and text emotion recognition are related. Sentiment analysis aims to determine opinions or attitudes about topics or objects (eg, a product, a video). Emotion recognition, on the other hand, focuses on recognizing emotions expressed in text without being tied to a specific target.[2] Sentiment analysis is widely used in companies to evaluate brands and services. Analysts in large companies use it to analyze public opinion, market research. There are many advantages of emotional analysis, such as forming a base of users/buyers who will benefit from the product, developing a marketing strategy.[3] Types of sentimental analysis There are several types of sentiment analysis. Let's consider them further: Aspect-based sentiment analysis - аnalysis of textual data is based on their aspects. It is used to relate an emotion and an aspect of a product. Fine-grained sentiment analysis - this type of analysis increases popularity accuracy. It can be conducted on different categories of data. Emotion detection - designed to detect specific emotions: anger, fear, happiness or neutrality. It is most often used in the analysis of texts. Intent analysis - the analysis is based on the motives and intentions on the basis of which the author wrote the given text All these types of sentiment analysis have a number of problems associated with: Sentences or phrases with irony and sarcasm Sentences or phrases taken out of context Phrases that can be understood ambiguously [3] These analyzes are carried out by many methods to minimize the problems indicated above. Methodology Let's consider the methodology of emotional analysis. Emotional analysis takes place mainly with the help of classification. It helps to understand exactly what emotion is embedded in a certain sentence or phrase. However, in order to proceed to the classification itself, it is necessary to do several stages of data processing, which we can see in Figure 1. Figure 2: General scheme of emotional analysis methodology[4] At the first stage, idioms and literals are collected. These are followed by data preprocessing. During it, words are translated into a certain case, punctuation marks are removed, etc. The last stage before training the pre-trained models is feature extraction. Next, we use one of the methods to categorize the text. Consider such methods as BERT, ROBERTA, K-BERT. BERT BERT is based on a search engine contextual connections between words. The advantage of BERT over other convergence models is that it reads all the words at once, rather than sequentially, which helps the model to be more accurate. The two main parts of the model are the encoder that reads the text and the decoder that predicts. Figure 2: General scheme BERT[5] K-BERT As the name makes clear, this method is based on BERT. It differs in that additional steps are added: creation of a tree of sentences, which is a knowledge layer. Also embedding layer, mask-transformer levels appear in the method. The general scheme of the K-BERT is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: General scheme K-BERT[4] RoBERTa For this model, tokenized data is converted into identifiers. Unlike BERT, in RoBERTa masking is performed during training, so the number of possible options is not limited. Also, for this model, training in longer sequences is possible. ROBERTA scheme is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: General scheme RoBERTa [6] Stacking model A meta-learning algorithm is used to combine one or more machine learning algorithms. That is why, after analyzing ready-made solutions, we came to the conclusion that the results of these methods can be connected using learning algorithms is known as stacking. This will help us get a more accurate result. The resulting scheme of the method is shown in the figure below. Figure 5: Stacking model Conclusion Sentimental analysis finds its use in many areas. This work showed its importance, types, as well as the problems it faces. 3 methods of sentiment analysis were considered. Based on the results of the method analysis, a model was built that combines the results of each method to increase accuracy.

42,Project Approach to Individualization of the Educational Process Using Mathematical Modeling,128,"Pryshchepa V., Yehorchenkov O."," Abstract. The process of learning in the modern world requires constant improvement in order to keep up with the trends of the time. That is why this paper presented the existing adaptation of AGILE methodology for education, which in turn is built directly on the value system of this methodology. On the basis of the adapted system of values it is possible to build a variety of educational programs, formulating their own values, clearly repulsed by the global understanding of the challenges of modern university education. To automate the process of individualization of learning was presented a mathematical model, which is built on the real characteristics of students and curricula. Keywords: learning methodology, individualization, education enviroment, Agile, mathematical modeling. University as an institution of education plays an important role in the development of society, while it is constantly influenced by the opposing sides of modern trends and traditions of classical education, global and local culture, the achievement of short-term plans and long-term goals the situation is complicated by the challenges faced by the university in the era of transition to the information society. Thus, due to the transformation, the main stakeholders of the process become the students [1]. On the one hand, they are used to constant learning since their childhood, mastering new technologies of the time [2], but on the other hand, students are not ready to spend a lot of time on professional development, they want to master new knowledge and get new competencies quickly and in the most convenient way [3]. Hence, traditional educational methods are losing their effectiveness when working with modern students [4]. The search for new ways of learning makes us turn to other spheres where we can borrow effective methods and practices [5]. Now it is generally recognized that one of the main means of improving the quality of the educational process in higher education is individualization of education. [6] As a new form of existence, the university turned to the AGILE philosophy, well established in software development. The philosophy of agile work allows universities to adapt quickly to changes in the environment and the requirements of employers. In addition, AGILE as a project management technology also allows students to develop project work skills. The application of this technology in education can have many rules and principles, but basically it can be reduced to 5 main ideas [7]. The first idea is teacher-student interaction. It was implemented in three variants: where in class the instructor asks students and initiates discussions with them, outside of class the instructor meets with students in consultations, additionally the instructor communicates with students through electronic means of communication. The second idea is goal-oriented learning. In the program of this pedagogy, this principle can be implemented as follows: the lesson material is structured to best meet the goals and objectives that have been defined in advance, at the beginning of each lesson the instructor explains to the students the goal and objectives of the current lesson. After the students have completed the tasks, there is a control activity in a short The main task of which is to evaluate how successfully the goals and objectives voiced by the instructor at the beginning of the class were achieved. The third idea is learning in pairs. Two students do work on a learning project. When one student directly performs the task, the second student observes his or her colleague, suggests ways to improve, alternative solutions to the problem, etc. Periodically, they switch places to ensure that both are fully engaged. The fourth idea is frequent interim control of students' knowledge. The final grade is averaged over all the grades received for the course, and the form of the interim control can be anything. This regular monitoring helps provide feedback to be able to keep a constant check on the process, even if the student has not been in pairs. The fifth idea is simplicity. This means that instructors should deliver the material in the simplest and clearest way possible so that students can easily absorb the material. Difficulties begin when the instructor cannot assess the students' ability to comprehend, in which case the topic becomes inaccessible to understanding of the students. Improvement of the task of individualization of education can be achieved by mathematical modeling of the process. In general, the task of such a model can be formalized using the terminology of multi-purpose systems (MS) . [6] Let the set of students with their individual characteristics be an external set in relation to the educational system, while its set of strategies is a set of alternative educational projects, for example, variants of the curriculum or technological map of the discipline. In this case, the local efficiency function f(x,y) determines the efficiency of training a set of students x∈X according to a set of curricula y∈Y. Individualization of training consists in the optimal choice of a subset of projects A={yi}, where i=1..m ⊂ Y and a distribution function E(x) defined on X. This function assigns to each student x∈X the number of the element A to which the student is assigned. The effectiveness of the educational system considered in the framework of the guaranteeing multi- purpose system (GMS) is characterized in this case by the minimum guaranteed quality of learning material for the entire sample of students, that is, the quality of training of the weakest student. The educational system considered in the framework of the integrated multipurpose system (IMS) is characterized by an average level of training for the entire sample. The development of this technology requires further research in this area and ongoing practical applications to improve the model.

43,Specifics of Project Quality Management,131,"Rymchuk V., Yehorchenkov O."," Abstract. The thesis reveals the theoretical essence of the quality management system in projects, examines the components and tools of the quality management system. The place of the quality management process in projects in the overall project management system is determined. Conclusions regarding the expediency of implementing a quality management system in the organization were considered and made. The purpose of this work is to study the quality management system in projects, as well as to determine the problems that arise when implementing such a system in the organization. Keywords: project management, quality management, project, quality management principles, quality management components, quality management problems. Formulation of the problem. Today, a new strategy has been created in the world, which interprets quality as the most important factor in ensuring the competitiveness of any company. In foreign practice, such two main elements regarding quality are distinguished as compliance with the goals of the project and compliance with consumer requirements. With the transition to market relations in Ukraine, the problem of quality appeared before every manufacturer. It is the solution of this problem that the project manager should deal with. The task of ensuring project quality is relevant at all phases of its life cycle. The new management policy is primarily based on the understanding by project participants of the vital need to ensure their quality. Analysis of recent research and publications. The study of the problems of quality management in projects in the activity of any enterprise was reflected in the works of domestic and foreign authors: I. A. Harutyunyan, V. I. Anina, A. O. Ichetovkina, V.V. Dragomirova, A.Ya. Kazarezova, L.B. Chirun, Y. M. Derenskaia, G. V. Starchenko and I. A. Baranyuk, etc. However, despite the attention of scientists to this issue, the theoretical aspects of quality management in projects remain relevant and require further research. Setting objectives. The purpose of this article is to reveal the essence of project management, as well as ways to increase the efficiency of the process of managing certain projects of an enterprise when implementing a quality management system. Presentation of the main research material. The general scheme of the organization of works to ensure the quality of the project includes the following components: Determining the work required to achieve the desired level of quality; Identification of persons responsible for the implementation of these works; Division of work into functional parts; Determination of persons responsible for the implementation of each work; Creating connections between different work activities [1]. The quality control system includes works in the project that affect the quality of the project's product. In the process of project quality management, four main components can be distinguished: Quality control planning (definition of goals, definition of resources, definition of quality standards, and criteria for achieving these standards) Quality control (verification and testing of what was determined at the quality planning stage, re-evaluation of both processes and product) Quality assurance (constant maintenance of documentation in an up-to- date state, training of employees in new processes) Quality improvement (control measures and monitoring of results to ensure that results meet expected criteria) [2]. In general, the advantages of implementing a quality management system in the project are: Quality products. Customer satisfaction Financial profits. Establishing communication [3]. However, the implementation of a quality management system in an organization that did not have one before presents a number of problems. The first place among such problems is the different opinions of the members of the organization regarding the quality management system since all the interested parties of the organization have a different idea of what exactly the quality management system should look like, and what are the final expectations for the quality management system in general. The solution to this problem is to organize communication with the senior management team, after which a presentation can be made to the employees, where any input and suggestions can also be considered and added. The next problem that often arises when implementing a project quality control system is the involvement and participation of personnel: as mentioned above, the use of the principles of consultation and participation of personnel is vital not only for the content of the quality management system but also for the involvement of employees in the process [4]. The project quality management process can be improved by using visual quality management tools such as: Affinity diagrams (generation and arrangement of product information) Diagrams of the decision-making program (determining what can go wrong in the project and planning such scenarios) Interrelationship diagrams (identification of changes that occur during work on the project and which parts these changes may affect) Matrix of priorities (determining which problems may arise and their priority) Network diagrams (demonstrates scope and critical path of the project) Matrix diagrams (demonstrates relationships between objectives, factors and causes) [5] Conclusions from this study and prospects for further development in this direction Thus, the process of project quality management at the enterprise in modern conditions is a whole system of organization, planning, implementation and improvement of project quality during the project cycle, aimed at effective achievement of goals through the use of modern methods and tools to achieve maximum results in ensuring product quality . The search for the latest approaches to improving the quality of the company's activity is one of the most urgent issues today. Its solution is possible due to the conceptual implementation of project quality management practices, taking into account the problems that arise when implementing a quality management system with the aim of reducing costs, aligning strategic planning at different levels, and achieving synergistic efficiency in the implementation of various types of enterprise activities.

44,Data Protection in the iOS Operating System,134,"Saiko V., Hrytsun Ya."," Abstract. The levels of protection of available options to securely store data in the iOS operating system are considered. For this purpose, guides to the use and programming of applications for the iOS operating system were used. The curated information reflects the features, structure, and levels of protection of two ways of storing information in digital form available for use in applied information systems developed for execution in the environment of the iOS operating system that is downloaded from cyberspace. Keywords: the levels of protection of digital data, iOS operating system, secure storage, file, Keychain. Given the large volume of information that passes through mobile devices and their limited storage capacity, the developers should skillfully manage available ways to store users’ sensitive data and the levels of protection they offer. The iOS operating system offers the following options to securely store data on a device: storage in files with several degrees of protection; storage using Keychain; Security levels storing data in files An application can store any number of files of any size, being limited only by the free space on the device. When creating a file, the developer indicates its security level. Below are all possible file security levels: ""Complete"" security level. Such files are stored in an encrypted format and can only be read or written when the device is unlocked. At other times, attempts to read and write the file will fail. ""Complete unless open"" security level. Similar to the ""Complete"" security level, but access to such a file is preserved even after the device is locked if the file was opened at the time when the device was unlocked. ""Complete until first user authentication"" security level. At this level, the file is not accessible until the user unlocks the device for the first time. After the user unlocks the device for the first time, the file remains available until the device is turned off or rebooted. ""No protection"" security level. Such files are stored unencrypted and can be accessed at any time. Overview and security level of data stored in Keychain Keychain is the most secure way to save small amounts of data. This level of security is powered by the hardware features of iOS devices. Storing data with Keychain, as in the case of writing to files, also has several levels of access available to the developer: ""When passcode set"" security level. These items are only available when the device is unlocked. To do this, a password must be set on the device.

These items are only available when the device is unlocked. If no password is set on the device, it is always considered unlocked. ""After first unlock"" security level. Access to these items is not possible until the user unlocks the device after rebooting; if no password is set on the device, it is always considered unlocked. Determination of the appropriate method of safe data storage To decide on the method of secure data storage in the context of a specific task, a developer can use the following overview table of the available approaches. Table 1 - Use cases overview of secure data storage methods In the final analysis, the iOS mobile operating system provides developers with two mechanisms for safe data storage: in files and Keychain storage with different degrees of protection.

45,IoT Control System for Technological Processes of Alcohol Production,136,"Sakharova S., Paliy S."," Abstract. The relevance of introducing automated systems in the production of alcohol based on the Internet of Things to improve and stabilize the quality of products, as well as reduce resource and energy costs in processes. Keywords: Internet of Things, automation systems, SCADA. The food industry, which specializes in the production of ethyl alcohol from food raw materials, is one of the major sectors of the national economy. A large number of parameters that determine product quality, complex patterns that characterize the technological process, and the desire to increase the profitability and competitiveness of manufactured products require the introduction of advanced technologies and a significant increase in the level of training of specialists in managing modern technological processes of food production. By automating production and making some adjustments to the system, you can get the following benefits: reduction of hard physical labor for workers directly involved in production; increase in labor productivity; increase in product quality; reduction of defects and waste; reducing the cost of raw materials and energy. The technological process for obtaining alcohol consists of the following steps: Preparation of raw materials and materials for saccharification and grinding of material; Boiling and saccharification of the raw material composition; Yeast cultivation; Fermentation of the resulting mass; Extraction	of	alcohol	from	a	mash	with	subsequent	purification (rectification). In the technological process of obtaining edible alcohol, the chemical and biological composition of the raw material and the physical and chemical properties of the water used to have a dominant influence on its quality. All this imposes increased technological requirements on the production process, which are solved both with the help of the improvement of old and the introduction of new technological solutions and with the use of automation tools [1]. One of the main types of technological equipment used in the alcohol industry is distillation units. The quality and cost of the manufactured products are largely determined by the bragorectification process. In the production of alcohol, the technological processes of bragorectification - rectification of the cultural alcohol-containing liquid - are the most energy-intensive and significantly impact the quality of the finished product. Therefore, the problems of improving and stabilizing the quality of manufactured products, as well as reducing resource and energy costs in the processes of distillation, are very relevant. One of the solutions is the creation of highly efficient and highly reliable automated control systems. Today's most promising automated control technology is SCADA systems (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition - supervisory control and data collection) [2, 3]. They are especially effective in creating an automated process control system for industries with human and material resource restrictions. It is proposed to develop an adaptive system for energy-efficient alcohol production at an industrial enterprise using the Internet of Things technology. In order to ensure the optimal flow of the production process, it is necessary to receive information on the values of current parameters in a timely manner and, at the same time, be able to compare them with the required values of the parameters of the technological process of alcohol production. Introducing such a system to your production, it is necessary to provide a prompt output of information about the current state of any required parameter, its deviation from the optimal set value, and the most optimal value of this parameter. To organize a system of automatic control and regulation of technological parameters of alcohol production, the following constituent elements are required: regulator (micro-computer or microprocessor controller); primary measuring transducers (pressure and temperature sensors); means of displaying information; executive mechanisms. The main requirements that should be presented to automatic control and regulation systems should be simplicity and ease of use [4], flexibility, survivability, and economy. Simplicity and ease of use are associated with the need to master systems without involving highly qualified specialists. The flexibility of a system is characterized by its ability to be upgraded. Survivability is associated with the preservation of performance not only under normal operating conditions but also under external emergency scenarios; in this case, the appearance of deterioration of control is allowed. Profitability is determined by low capital investments and operating costs. The stated requirements are satisfied by the systems of automatic control, regulation, and control built on the basis of microprocessor controllers and microcomputers.

46,Combining the Internet of Things and Data Analytics in Animal Health Care,138,"Shats H., Kravchenko O."," Abstract. In recent days, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been used to connect many devices and communicate with each other, creating a greater impact on animal health systems. IoT devices take the form of wearables that have been used to track people's activities. Wearable devices are now being used to monitor animal activity. Internet of Things in animal health research uses biosensors and software to monitor and maintain animal health records. Such technologies produce accurate predictions of health and disease that are most effective for humans, but can be applied to animals with minor modifications. Some of these recent technologies have gained importance for use in animal health and development. The integration of affordable medical sensors creates a connected digital platform that improves connectivity for pets and livestock. But just collecting information with the help of sensors does not reflect the condition of the animal and does not predict morbidity. Without modern analytical methods and business intelligence tools, it is impossible to investigate the exact changes in the vital activity indicators of animals. Keywords: Analytical methods, Animal health care, Internet of things The combination of Internet of Things, wireless technology and analytics enables animal watchers to monitor animal health from anywhere. Nowadays, engineering and sensing research together have reduced the cost of electronic devices and led to the introduction of biosensing and intelligent computing solutions that incorporate cloud resources and Internet connectivity to create cyber-physical systems [1]. These cyber-physical systems facilitate the autonomous acquisition of data such as physiological parameters, dairy farm environment, yield measurements and features. Similarly, electronic devices have become an integral part of human life, which are interconnected and interact with each other. IoT devices are self-realizing, facilitated by machine-readable identification, and can transmit data across networks without human intervention. Smart sensors are a key enabler of low-power IoT. Smart sensors and communications have become dominant factors that will transform the communication, sensing and computing technologies and devices of the next generation. A large number of researchers are working on animal care systems. The system developed by Sweta Jha et al. (2017), which was supposed to be able to identify and rapidly detect diseases affecting livestock [2]. The sensors used were connected to a microcontroller, and if the data received was outside the normal range, the farmer could detect that a particular cow was sick and take the necessary measures. Wireless sensor networks also monitored physical conditions such as humidity, pressure and temperature, storing the data in a central location and providing access to it via a web page. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the animal health monitoring system are also finding their users. Such a system was proposed by two researchers, Shinde & Prasad (2017) [3]. The technique used by the authors consisted of two different architectures: one for animal health monitoring and the other for crop monitoring. For the animal monitoring system, a method of supplying power to wireless sensor devices using a battery and regularly replacing it and setting up a unique channel for data transmission between network devices between sensor nodes was used. Such IoT systems are a good example of data collection and processing. For farmers who do not understand the collected data, it is important to understand the information received. Although new digital tools make animal disease monitoring more accessible, timely analysis of animal vital signs data for meaningful information can be challenging. Business intelligence software has the potential to solve these problems. Jason David Wark (2022) conducted research on the feasibility of using business intelligence tools in conjunction with the Internet of Things to improve proactive zoo animal welfare reporting. Business intelligence software combines the ability to integrate multiple data streams with advanced analytics and robust data visualization. As a result, the author created a system that uses Microsoft Power BI in combination with a data acquisition system. The system meets the needs of keepers in proactively reporting on the welfare of animals in the zoo. Conclusions. The latest technology has undoubtedly improved the management of animal health by enabling data acquisition, real-time medical intervention, decision- making and process automation at a reduced cost. The combination of Internet of Things technologies and data analytics allows you to qualitatively monitor the vital signs of animals and in advance predict morbidity. Various sensors and other technologies used in animal health were reviewed from the perspective of domestic, farm and wild animals. Researchers and development organizations have begun to find solutions to improve animal health. Investments should be made in technologies in the field of animal husbandry, which are not yet sufficiently developed and are not used to their full extent.

47,Responsibility of the Parties for Information Security Management in Cloud Technologies,140,"Shcheblanin Yu., Zahynei A."," Abstract. The article considers the issues of information resources protection using cloud technologies. A study was conducted on the delimitation of the responsibilities of the provider and the customer of cloud services for the application of information resource protection technologies. The principles of interaction that can be the basis of trust between the customer and the cloud service provider are considered. Keywords: Cloud technology, cloud services, PaaS, IaaS, SaaS Cloud technologies are used in many areas of human activity. The issue of ensuring the protection of information processed in such systems remains relevant today. The separation of responsibilities for the use of protection technologies is determined individually in each system, however, there must be certain principles that gives the capabilities and effectiveness of security management. Relevant principles are given in the table. 1 [1]: Table 1 – Principles of interaction of the customer of services and the provider of cloud computing There are three types of cloud technology models: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) [2]. SaaS is a specific type of software product that is cloud-based and can be easily accessible via the web interface. PaaS are platforms that provided to the end user to create their own objects and software products. IaaS is an infrastructure that allows the system administrator to deploy its own systems and structures. Given these models, it is possible to build the responsibility of each party (provider and end user), as shown in Figure 1 [3]. Figure 1 – Responsibility for compliance with the safety of cloud technologies The service provider is responsible for physical protection regardless of the cloud technology model. This means the control of access control systems, video surveillance cameras, fire safety equipment, etc. [3]. Protection of the operating system, or operating systems (if they are several, and they interact within a single virtualization system) relies on the technology provider in the case of SaaS and PaaS. For example, the task of setting up the server part on which the software development platform is deployed, or the service is assigned to the provider. In the case when the provider provides its own infrastructure, where the user uses virtualization tools to create their own infrastructure, the protection of operating systems rests with the user. The protection of a particular service, site, database deployed in «cloud » rests with the end user, ie the customer. All settings of such systems are performed by the customer administrator. Conclusions Nowadays, it is quite simple to deploy your own system using cloud technologies, but the issue of information protection, which is processed in this system, is still relevant. It is impossible to ensure the security of such a system without clear and high-quality interaction with the provider, so the work offered reference models on the basis of which you can build your own information protection systems. When distinguishing responsibilities between the parties for security, it is necessary to focus primarily on the capabilities of each party and the effectiveness of the remedies they use.

48,Overview and Ways to Improve Modern Systems for Managing Projects and Tracking Current Tasks,142,"Shlapak O., Yehorchenkov O."," Abstracts. Modern programs for tracking issues, designed for organizing communication with users and project management, are considered. In particular, the following systems: Jira, Trello. Also, their main shortcomings are considered and it is proposed to add new functionality that solves some of them. Keywords: JIRA, Trello, project management software, timeline, progress tracking. Today, there are many programs for tracking issues, designed for organizing communication with users, as well as for project management. Let's take for example a well-known program from the developer of Atlassian Corporation Plc - Jira. Initially, the Jira system was created as a solution for tracking tasks and bugs. But today, Jira is a powerful work management tool suitable for a variety of cases, from requirements management and test scenarios to agile software development [1]. But nothing in the world is perfect, and neither is Jira. The main problems of the software program [2]: The tool is difficult to set up and get used to Its complex user interface can make task management difficult No built-in timeline to track project progress No collaboration features to communicate with the team It is mainly designed for teams of engineers and software developers No idea management features to keep track of your ideas and plans It is known as a slow tool with long query load times I would also like to consider the Trello System, a visual tool that allows a team to manage various projects and work processes and track the completion of tasks [3]. The main problems of the software program [4]: Trello's commenting feature needs improvement. No built-in timeline to track project progress It is suitable for small projects. However, this can be a problem if the team grows and the project becomes more complex Among the above problems, I would like to highlight the timeline, because both the customer and stakeholders want to see the project development process in general. They need to see clearly at what speed the project is heading towards its completion and when it can be presented to the general audience. Unfortunately, Jira and its analogues do not have such functionality yet, so I would like to offer my solution to this problem. Figure.1 Timeline by weeks Figure. 2 Timeline by steps (phases) As shown above, the following timelines can be added: By weeks By phases of the project life cycle This tool will provide an in-depth overview of the entire project from start to finish. Helps you see when a task starts and when it needs to be completed. Also, does it depend on another task. That is why it is important to have this tool at hand. Of course, you can do it and update it manually with Excel, but it will take a lot of time and will have a negative impact on productivity. The timeline will help you more easily navigate the development and release of the project. The developed tool will be used by customers, project managers and developers to predict the completion of project development, understanding the steps that must be taken to complete the work on time. Conclusion: So, in this work, two main tools for project management and monitoring of current tasks were considered. Their weaknesses are identified, and own ideas for improving their work and functionality are proposed.

49,IoT Solutions and Drones in Localization of Emergency Accidents,144,"Shvydchenko A., Kuchansky A."," Abstracts. The research developed an IoT system for dealing with emergencies. The study's relevance is due to the development of the Internet of Things and unmanned aerial vehicle technologies, which saves life, property, and equipment from the consequences of sabotage or an accidental incident. The need to create a system capable of dealing with emergency situations (man-made and natural), able to meet the need to ensure the safety of rescuers and victims of an emergency. Keywords: IoT, unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, sensors, automation. Today, the technologies of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) are becoming more and more common and are used in many companies and government institutions. Examples of the successful use of drones are the armed forces of many countries using unmanned aerial vehicles for reconnaissance, the Amazon company working on a delivery system using unmanned aerial vehicles, and private and public agricultural enterprises. Drones can perform tasks automatically after receiving the necessary information, and they can navigate in space with the help of installed sensors, GPS, and machine learning. Such IoT solutions are tested in practice by the company ""Amazon"" with its project ""Prime Air"" [1]. The study developed an IoT system for dealing with emergencies. However, the idea of the system can also be used in such fields as the agricultural sector (protection of property and products), the armed forces (protection of equipment, BC warehouses, and soldiers from accidents, the consequences of sabotage or enemy shelling), security enterprises and national police bodies (assistance in investigations of incidents and offenses as a tool of technical supervision), etc. In addition to the ability to work and respond to certain events remotely, using drones increases the efficiency of using resources. One of the main advantages of using drones in the agricultural sector is the optimization of the use of chemicals, reduced risk to human life, reduced harmful effects on the environment, and high application efficiency. All this leads to high competitiveness [2]. Therefore, using drones and the corresponding IoT systems increases the efficiency of the use of resources. In turn, IoT technologies are already used in the development of systems, the purpose of which is to ensure the safety of people, which, in turn, can be used in the proposed system. This study analyzed the ""SAFETYSCAPE"" system, which is a system for generating an escape route based on information received from BLE (Bluetooth) beacons with built-in temperature sensors and ESP32 microcontrollers working with a gas detector [3]. This system, combined with the technology of unmanned aerial vehicles, given its modularity, has the potential to become an effective rapid response system in the event of a fire. The system can be used in residential buildings or office premises and strategic facilities such as nuclear power plants, thermal power plants, essential warehouses, or factories. At these objects, drones can perform a wide range of tasks and respond to various possible emergencies, from fires and neutralizing chemicals to evacuation and providing the victims and rescuers of the objects with everything necessary: tools, water, medicine, etc. An essential element of the research is the combination of the IoT system with the task of optimal placement of emergency stations. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure a higher level of coverage by stations in the relevant region, the minimum cost of construction and operation, etc. Work [4] describes placing emergency stations appropriately considering the identified risks. For this, the idea of two-level programming on the modified NSGII genetic algorithm is used.

50,Selection of Protocols for Real-Time Data Streaming from IoT Devices to the Cloud for Further Analysis,146,"Shykhmat A., Veres Z."," Abstract. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables the creation of networks between devices, humans, applications, and the Internet, creating new ecosystems with higher productivity, better energy efficiency, and higher profitability. Nodes in the networks should be able to communicate and exchange data. For this purpose, data protocols are used. This paper provides an overview of existing data protocols, compares each protocol's strengths and weaknesses, and performance for MQTT and HTTP protocols, and selects the best-fil protocol for the real-time data transmission use case. Keywords: SOAP, HTTP, REST, CoAP, WebSocket, XMPP, MQTT, AMQP An outdated technical and technological base is one of the significant problems in Ukraine. Frequent malfunctions require larger capital investments and more time to solve them, which reduces volumes and increases the cost of growing crops, leading to increased final prices for the consumer. According to a Global Network Against Food Crises study, rising prices are leading to starvation in many regions of the world. The most crucial aspect of agriculture vehicles is timely repair and maintenance. Agriculture vehicles are manufactured in such a way that they can withstand thousands of hours of service. However, these indicators can be achieved only under the condition of periodic maintenance of the tractor. Timely detection and prevention of malfunctions are key approaches to reducing maintenance costs, and updating and replacing equipment, reducing the cost of growing crops. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology can be used to solve this problem. It is possible to create an IoT device that will connect to the CAN bus of the tractor to intercept all signals, process them, track the geographic position of the tractor at the current moment in time and tie the signals to this position. Finally, this data needs to be transmitted to some server-side with geospatial and telemetry data for further analysis. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of existing data protocols and selects the best-fil protocol for the real-time data transmission use case. Qualitative analysis using Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method [7] and performance analysis were used to select data protocol from the following list: SOAP, HTTP, REST, CoAP, WebSocket, XMPP, MQTT, AMQP. Each protocol’s sensitivity points, tradeoff points, risks, and applicability to the use case quality attribute scenarios were analyzed. SOAP is verbose and complex from a coding perspective, with a slow parsing speed and does not have built-in functionality for failed requests processing re-try, but it is versatile and has built-in error handling that can make resolving issues easier [2,3]. The advantages of using REST are its simplicity, security, and scalability. However, the disadvantages include the impossibility of sending one message to many recipients with one request, the increased need for server resources, and the increased time for sending and processing the request, as is built on top of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), comparing to application protocols built on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) transport layer protocol, and the lack of automatic resending of a message in the event of a message processing error on the server, which reduces reliability [4]. CoAP protocol has advantages in its reduced need for client resources, security using DTLS, synchronous and asynchronous communication support, and fast message transfer. Disadvantages include lower reliability of data transmission (compared to application protocols built on the TCP transport layer protocol), the inability to send one message to many recipients (for this, you need to send a separate message to each recipient), problems with communication with NAT devices [5]. The advantages of the WebSocket protocol are the fast message exchange since it is not necessary to open a connection between the client and the server every time, the reduced volume of traffic, and the security using TLS. The main disadvantages of WebSocket include the requirement for a stable TCP connection and the lack of automatic connection restoration in case the connection is lost, which reduces the reliability of this protocol, increased requirements for node resources, and problems with scaling and load distribution [1]. The main advantages of the XMPP protocol are its simple addressing, scalability, and security. Still, it has its disadvantages, in the form of slower transmission and data processing due to increased traffic volume, because of XML format, the TCP transport protocol usage, and the reliability is reduced because there is no confirmation of message processing [1]. MQTT has advantages in its scalability, architecture that provides loose coupling between clients, reliability because it guarantees different types of message delivery, and security using SSL/TLS. Disadvantages include slower sending of messages (compared to application protocols built on top of the UDP transport layer protocol) [1]. Like MQTT, the AMQP protocol has advantages in scalability, security, and loosely coupled clients. Disadvantages include increased message size and time to send and process the message [6] The MQTT protocol is the best solution for real-time data streaming from constrained environments. This protocol depends on reliable connection and could be inefficient in situations with a weak or absent Internet connection.

According to the tests performed to deliver 1K messages over MQTT and HTTP - MQTT was shown almost 20 times faster and required almost 55 times less traffic on the task of posting consistent time-valuable data and is more efficient from a power consumption point of view: A number of areas of research that have to be conducted to build an information system to monitor and predict agriculture vehicles faults have been identified, among which the following should be highlighted: Receiving signals from the CAN bus by the IoT device; Tracking of the agriculture vehicle geographical position by the IoT device; Transformation of signals and geographical position into geospatial and telemetry data by an IoT device; Processing of data that was not sent on time due to IoT device network connectivity issues Storage of the received geospatial and telemetry data using cloud solutions; Analysis of stored data and detection of malfunctions that have been already occurred using cloud services; Creating a model to predict potential failures and notify farmers about them.

51,Security Project Management,149,"Sokol-Chernilovska K., Yehorchenkov O."," Abstract. Software errors can be introduced by disconnects and miscommunications during the planning, development, testing, and maintenance of the components. The likelihood of disconnects and miscommunications increases as more system components have to satisfy security requirements. Project managers should consider the additional communications requirements, linkage among life-cycle activities, and the potential usage environment as these items relate to security needs. Keywords: security project management, protection of information services, security project management responsibilities. Over time, technologies have tended to evolve and improve. But the rapid pace leaves enough gaps that are further used to cause harm for a specific purpose. However, methods of crime prevention (both cybercrime and ordinary) are also not standing still. Protection of state information resources and other objects of critical information infrastructure is significant within the framework of present Ukraine. According to officially published statistics [1], among the state information resources connected to the system of secure access of state authorities to the Internet, official web representations	of	the	President	of	Ukraine	(president.gov.ua, petition.president.gov.ua), sites of the Security Service of Ukraine [2], the State Bureau of Investigation and the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine are most often attacked. So, we see numerous vulnerable objects, but this is only a tiny part of the whole picture. It comes to a private business as well. Security has become an integral attribute of every company that cares about its customers, users, and employees. Large corporations are starting to create departments dedicated exclusively to product safety and company safety policies. Usually, the team size exceeds ten people, and for effective management of the processes, it is necessary to involve a project manager to coordinate the operations. A security project manager's responsibilities are to supervise the creation of security systems for companies and organizations to ensure the safety and protection of personnel, campus assets, and information. The security project manager leads a team or teams of security professionals to generate a plan of action to mitigate threats to the company. This person's duties may also include helping a company create policies to improve site security, running safety drills and tests of the safety systems, and training staff on how to follow safety procedures and help improve security through individual action steps. The security project manager must also understand and apply municipal, state, and federal regulations related to the installation and implementation of security equipment. Based on the previous paragraph, it is evident that a security project manager should be at least a bachelor's degree in the technology field, such as computer science (cybersecurity), along with relevant experience. Additional qualifications include excellent technical, analytical problem-solving, and communication skills and leadership ability to oversee projects and staff. What is needed to become an effective security project manager: At least 3-4 years of project management experience in the IT industry to gain expertise in usual project management; High-level understanding of cybersecurity; Experience in gathering/processing/preparing project requirements; Experience in long/mid/short term planning for scrum teams, change management; Understanding of web development principles and SDLC; Excellent stakeholders management skills; Ability to coordinate multiple projects in a changing environment (because security departments can be separated into few groups such as Network, Application, Physical, Offensive security, etc., it means that the security project manager should seal with few teams at the same time); Excellent written and verbal communication skills; Upper-intermediate (and higher) written and spoken English. What is also essential, as businesses become more reliant on technology, the need for better communication between security and business teams becomes increasingly crucial. This is because security professionals need to be able to communicate the risks that are present in order to get the support they need to do their jobs effectively. Project managers can play a vital role in this process by helping to bridge the gap between security and business teams. They can do this by developing effective communication channels and creating opportunities for collaboration. In addition, they can also help to ensure that security concerns are addressed promptly. Security project managers can advance their careers by taking on larger and more complex projects. As they gain experience, they will be able to handle more responsibility and may eventually be promoted to a senior management position. In addition, security project managers certified by a professional organization such as the Project Management Institute (PMI) will have an advantage when competing for jobs. To sum up, the world is rapidly developing and changing, so new job positions such as security project manager appear on the market. It is essential to understand this person's role and importance within the company.

52,Recommendations of Using Microsoft Azure Devops in Agile Project Management,151,"Sukhina K., Kubiavka L."," Abstract. Microsoft Azure DevOps offers the interactive and modifiable project management tools. The agile planning and portfolio management features of Azure Boards enable project managers to rapidly plan, organize, and monitor the work of your whole team. This article describes the best practices of agile project management, along with the primary benefits and features of using Azure DevOps in the workflow of project management. Keywords: Microsoft Azure DevOps, Agile project management, features, planning, organizing, monitoring Microsoft Azure DevOps (MS ADO) is an environment which support collaboration of the project team with the client in order to develop a product effectively and due to selected methodology. MS ADO is customizable cloud environment which supports Agile, Kanban and Scrum methodologies of project management. This article lists basic recommendations of setting up MS ADO by project managers. Firstly, user control should be set up in MS ADO environment. Project Managers (PM) should have Admin role with the full license; therefore, they have access to setting up and editing of dashboards, backlogs, test plans and other services. The most beneficial feature of MS ADO is real time updating and collaboration of client users and project members, which helps to build strong and effective communication during the development of the product by assigning of work items, adding descriptions and comments, prioritizing of work items therefore the proper source could be notified about required action. Secondly, it is very important how the project backlog is set up. Backlogs are where PMs handle the work items that are waiting to be completed. Backlogs are used for the planning of both the product and its features as well as the organization of the labor. Backlogs are capable of being segmented into tiers in accordance with project requirements. The kinds of problems that are assigned to each backlog are determined by the workflow type that has been chosen. The following is a list of the three primary categories of backlogs: the Portfolio backlog, often known as a higher-level backlog consisting of epics and features; the Iteration backlog is a task-level backlog for each iteration that is time- scoped; the Requirement backlog is a more thorough backlog that includes problems, product backlog items, or user stories [1]. Epics of the backlog is workstream areas of the project which consists of features of the product and a separate epic for project management activities, such as meeting planning, project documentation creation, controlling of risks and others. Each feature could include user stories or processes, to which test cases and requirements are linked. Test cases could be linked with bugs and issues reported by the client during UAT testing. In addition, this backlog could be represented in the form of Boards which consists of cards with brief information about pending work that are divided by columns which are statuses (New, In Progress, Confirmed, Closed, Cancelled and others) of work items. PMs could use this Board on status meetings to track progress of the project workflow. Therefore, such structure organizes the work on the project and simplify finding of the information by users, as well as makes monitoring of project processes by PMs and workstream leads more effective. Thirdly, Iteration Paths, which are often commonly referred to as sprints, provide PMs the ability to allocate work items to certain time intervals. At the project level, iteration paths are specified, and individual team members are given the option to pick and choose which ones they need to use while creating new work item in the backlog. PMs have the option of building a flat set of iteration paths or a hierarchical collection of iteration pathways in order to facilitate releases, sub-releases, and sprints [2]. Iterations are used throughout the planning process. Although MS ADO is capable of automatically forecasting the amount of work that will need to be done, it is challenging to accurately and completely record every work item up front. Because of this, it's possible that forecasts will be inaccurate. Scrum employs a sprint planning cycle in an effort to tackle this issue. In Scrum, PMs would just schedule the work for the next two weeks, pulling in work from the backlog, and learning how much it could be completed in an iteration. On the other hand, the Kanban method relies on a continuous pull rather than on discrete planning cycles. It could be advantageous to utilize iterations just as planning cycles, despite the fact that releases are not required to be a part of iterations [3]. Thus, each iteration should include the number of processes of product development along with project management activities, for effective and precise forecasting of sources’ capacity and schedule by iteration (sprint). To monitor sprints, it is recommended to use sprint burn-down chart, which should be reviewed by PMs at the beginning and at the end of the sprint, to update statuses of work items, assign tasks and discuss issues and blockers with project team and client team separately. In addition, PM could use extending functionality of MS ADO Dashboards which allow PMs to construct individualized views, giving them the ability to obtain insight into project current state, assess progress, and do trend analysis. The freedom to exchange information and the improvement of workflow procedures are both provided by dashboards, which allows sharing of information and track workflow progress [3]. Variety of analytics reports are already included into MS ADO, such as control charts, cumulative flow diagrams, and burn charts, so that workflow patterns may be better comprehended. Charts available for pipelines as well as build health and for evaluating issues. PMs may add charts to dashboards or view them independently using the Azure Boards tool, which is connected to the functionality [3]. The recommendation is to set up dashboard by workstream, each of which should include statistics about: recently created work items (user stories, processes, features and others), pending tasks (due dates, assigned to), blockers (bugs and issues), test results (passed and failed test cases, tested by). These Dashboards should be reviewed on weekly project team meeting with development team and client users. In conclusion, using of Microsoft Azure DevOps environment along with suggested recommendation in this article could help project managers organize work on the implementation or development project and simplify communications between team and client users, as well as monitor the progress of work. Therefore, the project team could focus more on the development and communication with client, rather then trying to catch the current project stage, or understand what is need to be done. Microsoft Azure DevOps fix project backlog of work at the mobilization and analysis phases, help track progress on design and development phase, and support work on GoLife phase of the project.

53,Human Resources Management as an Investment for Projects,154,"Surovtseva O., Yehorchenkov O."," Abstract. In this work, we have determined why investing in human resources is a long-term investment for projects and can be a valuable project assets. It was also concluded what tasks the human resource manager performs and what his role is in managing human resources in projects. It is emphasized that manager’s attitude to employees has a great influence on the efficiency of work performed by employees. Results of this research can become the basis for further researches and bring a certain contribution to study of resources management in projects. Keywords: human resources, human capital, investment, employees, project management, training, recruiting. Employees are not just resource, but rather capital or assets for projects. Due to this, a new term emerged outside human resources, namely human capital. Here human resources must be seen not only as the main asset, but as assets that are valuable and can be multiplied, developed (compared to investment portfolios) and not vice versa as liabilities. The perspective of human resources as an investment for projects is more prominent [1]. The purpose of the work is to determine why it is necessary to invest in human resources in projects and what the role of an HR manager is in this field. The relevance of the research is approved by the fact that this theme has not been fully explored in the field of project management. Currently, the role of the manager’s influence on the work of employees and the leading of projects has been little studied. Nevertheless, the HR manager performs several functions in the company such as identifying the needs of employees, recruiting and training the best employees, control of working process, managing employee payroll, benefits and compensation, increasing employee motivation [2]. It appears that project success requires success in project team management, which is a function of HR. Three main processes are taken into account: recruiting, training and management. They represent the levels of the HR department's overall role in project management. They are described and analyzed, while raising the key issues that have to be faced [6]. It is accepted that investments in human capital include training. Training equips employees with the skills and confidence they need to achieve organizational goals. Investing in employee development increases retention as well as their ability to create value [5]. Besides, investing in human resources encourages employees to work together and identify improvements that will directly benefit them. These investments often open up channels of communication between departments and levels of management, allowing human capital to flow more freely within the organization. This is especially important in construction, given that the work of each department usually either builds on or serves as the basis for the work of another [4]. According to several studies, employees can be much more productive when their bosses and managers give them more attention. The father of human relations, Elton Mayo, was the first to emphasize the importance of employee communication, collaboration, and inclusion [3]. His research concluded that sometimes human factors are more important than physical factors such as lighting quality and workplace conditions. As a result, people in today's society often place more value on how they feel than on other working conditions. For example, the reward system in human resource management is effectively applied because in all work, employees should be valued and rewarded, which can stimulate them to continue to achieve their best results. Strategic investments in human capital can bring unprecedented returns to the projects that employees work on.

54,Leveraging Metaverse Digital Economies for Business Opportunities,156,"Svoboda I., Steshenko G."," Abstract. The growing interest in the idea of metaverse attracts both new capital and consumers. The article describes what business models can be used to leverage this rapidly growing and largely untapped new market. Keywords: Metaverse, business, blockchain, information technology, virtual reality. The metaverse is a digital reality that combines aspects of social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact virtually [1]. Although the term itself is now 30 years old, only recently with the advancements in technology we were able to recreate the concept [2]. The concept of the metaverse is not exclusive to a single player. There exist dozens, if not hundreds of virtual worlds that can match the definition, although there are only a few major players that are currently pushing the boundary, namely Meta with their “Horizon Worlds”, Roblox platform, VRChat virtual world, and blockchain- powered Decentraland [3]. When talking about types of the metaverse, we can make a clear distinction between centralized, also known as “Web 2.0”, and the decentralized metaverse. While centralized metaverse is fully owned and operated by a business entity that created it (Roblox, Horizon Worlds), the decentralized metaverse type is largely not connected with a single business entity, and all assets are owned by the users instead of being “leased”. Examples of the second type can be Decentraland and, to a lesser extent, VRChat [4]. Figure 1 – Metaverse revenue growth projection Currently, the centralized metaverse platforms are the largest revenue generator, with a “premium” subscription being a large portion of the cash inflow. However, it is projected that over the next several years decentralized platforms will leap forward, more than doubling total metaverse revenue generated to $400 billion and reducing the importance of subscription-based revenue systems in favor of direct in-platform spending [3]. With the rapidly evolving and expanding scope of metaverse platforms, new and previously unseen business opportunities begin to appear. For simplicity, we can group them into several categories [4]: Marketing & Advertising Events & Conferences Virtual Assets Creation Product Development Virtual Goods Commerce Currently, the most well-explored categories are marketing & advertisement for well-established businesses willing to tap into the metaverse userbase and virtual asset creation for small entrepreneurs working strictly inside metaverse platforms and catering to the local digital communities [5]. However, over the past year, two more categories, namely events & conferences and metaverse product development have risen to prominence. Events & conferences are a great way for established businesses to bring new experiences to both their existing consumers, but also employees and investors. While the Roblox platform is actively used as a virtual venue for popular artists and brands to promote themselves, Meta is actively promoting its virtual world as a place to hold conferences and a new type of work collaboration [6]. On the other side of the spectrum, small creative teams began to develop programs, modifications, and tools for existing metaverse platforms, catering to the metaverse users looking for advanced features and experiences. Finally, we have virtual goods commerce as an emerging and not yet fully realized business opportunity. Just as virtual assets are created by members of the metaverse platforms, they can be purchased and sold by the other members of the platform. Usually, these marketplaces cater to users that would like to acquire something that is not available from inside the platform, or, oppositely, they would like to sell a unique asset for a good profit [7]. In conclusion, while the metaverse is only emerging as a real-life concept, it has already attracted billions in investments and generated billions in revenue. Such a new, but rapidly growing market creates a lot of previously unseen business opportunities that we have yet to discover. This paper focuses on exploring just the most popular and visible ones.

55,Approach to Automatic Verification of Answers to Open Questions When Performing Control Measures,158,"Tmienova N., Chernenko A."," Abstract. In universities of Ukraine, control measures are held annually, and open questions make up a large part of them. In order to automate the process of checking answers to open questions, there was developed an approach, which consists in automatically comparing the student's answers with the teacher's reference version of the answer. The approach is based on a combination of Natural Language Processing methods and tools. Keywords: control measures, open questions, Natural Language Processing, standard, n-grams, semantic analysis, parse tree, RAKE algorithm, cosine distance, LSTM, CNN, word2vec, BeautifulSoup. In universities of Ukraine, every year a large number of control measures are held - independent works, modular control works, tests and exams, which can have a different structure, but in most cases they contain test or open questions, and often their combination. And if, in the case of tests, platforms provide an automatic check function along with the possibility of forming questions, then the teacher has to check the answers to open questions, and this process has certain disadvantages. The first drawback is that the teacher has a number of signs or subjective traits that are inherent to a person and that can affect the rational evaluation of a student's work. For example, a teacher may have characteristics such as illness, bad mood or other features that may negatively affect the evaluation process and make it not objective. The second disadvantage is the teacher's personal involvement in the evaluation process, which can lead to a situation where the teacher is accused of being biased towards the student. In order to prevent such situations from arising, it is better that the verification of answers to open questions is performed by an automatic system, which will make the evaluation process objective. Such a system can be implemented using an approach that consists in automatically comparing the student's answers with a reference version of the teacher's answer using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, such as lemmatization, keyword extraction, knowledge tree construction, named entity recognition, and others [1]. The algorithm of such system can be divided into several stages: preparatory stage – adding a standard, keywords, dictionaries and own text base; 1st stage – splitting the input text into sentences; 2nd stage – checking for full compliance to the standard variant; 3rd stage – semantic analysis of sentences; 4th stage – combining the results. We will describe in more detail the 2nd and 3rd stages of the algorithm. At the 2nd stage of checking for complete compliance with the reference option, a comparison of the reference value (the teacher's answers) with the student's answer will be performed by applying methods based on symbols using n-grams - sequences of the n numbers of symbols and words used together [2] . For this, it is necessary to establish connections between the sentences (strong or weak), break the sentences into n-grams and build a binary matrix (for the standard and for the tested text). Next, it is necessary to calculate the threshold for the similarity of sentences 𝜆 =  𝑁𝑠, 𝑁𝑎 where Ns is the number of identical n-grams, Na is the total number of n-grams. The general level of compliance is establishing according to the matrix. If it corresponds to a certain specified value, then we complete the work, if it does not correspond, then we proceed to the next stage. At the 3rd stage, it is necessary to perform a semantic analysis of sentences. As a result, those sentences that exceeded the threshold λ will be excluded, but can be used for the analysis of other sentences. This stage can be divided into the following 3 sub-stages: search in downloaded documents from the relevant academic discipline; corpus search; internet search. The search by downloaded documents is carried out using keywords contained in the question. To obtain keywords, we can use the RAKE algorithm [3] or another, if it gives a better result, use the metric to search for less used words and, having already found them in the sources, we can perform semantic analysis of the context. Next, an analysis is performed using the corpus, which is replenished in the process of working with the program. For this purpose, you can use parsing trees and parsers formed on their basis [4], as well as use the approach based on the cosine distance between the words of one and another sentence, which is described in [5], but taking into account some specified stop words and linking them to a certain word or set of words. It is also possible to apply the approach using LSTM and CNN networks, described in [6] or word2vec, described in [7], taking into account the independence of words among themselves. The last one is internet search and analysis. For this, we can use a tool like BeautifulSoup [8] or a similar approach for obtaining the content of web resources and performing its semantic analysis. The disadvantage of the proposed approach is a large number of operations, but the quality of verification has a much higher priority than speed, and the increase in computing power every year will be able to overcome this disadvantage over time. For practical implementation, the best programming language is Python, because it provides many tools for processing text, such as nltk, spacy, and others. Functionality in these libraries can act as ready-made tools, or can be used as parts of more complex approaches.

56,Comparison of Neural Network Algorithms Efficiency in Data Center Cybersecurity,161,"Toliupa S., Shestak Ya., Torchylo A."," Abstract. This paper proposes a research for neural network architectures in order to evaluate the performance of the application of neural network algorithms in accordance with the target indicators of the accuracy of machine analysis. At the same time, it is proposed a comparison of classical neural network architectures, which are characterized by a minimal load on the hardware resource of the machine analysis system, with neural network architectures of deep learning. Keywords: data center, multi-layer autoencoder, cyber attack, deep belief network, convolutional neural network, recursive neural network. Neural network algorithms are widely considered relevant in solving the problem of identifying and classifying cyber attack patterns nowadays. At the first stage, based on a set of statistical analysis indicators {𝑁𝑇𝑃 , 𝑁𝑇𝑁, 𝑁𝐹𝑃, 𝑁𝐹𝑁} presented in studies [1, 2], it is proposed to determine the ranges of values for the objective functions {𝐹𝐴𝐿 }and {𝐹𝑃𝐿}for the architecture of the autoencoder and multi-level autoencoder according to equation (1). The calculation results demonstrate that the classical neural network architectures shows mediocre performance values. When moving from a standard autoencoder (values of the objective functions 𝐹0 and 𝐹0 ) to a deep learning neural network of the multi-layered autoencoder (values 𝐴𝐿	𝑃𝐿 of the objective functions 𝐹+ and 𝐹+ ), the accuracy of the analysis does not increase, 𝐴𝐿	𝑃𝐿 but the spread of values significantly decreases, which makes it possible to fix the target indicators at the maximum possible level of this model of values. The reliability of the application of the deep learning architecture is based on the comparison of the values obtained at the output of each layer, which corresponds to a separate autoencoder, with the next layer. In turn, neural network algorithms based on deep belief network (DBN) architecture are based on the composition of basic neural networks and classification layers. Within the framework of the SIEM system, this approach highlights high-level features of the code at the level of deobfuscation. In addition to the basic architecture (values of the objective functions 𝐹𝐷 and 𝐹𝐷 ), the research paper presents modeling results for DBN with a linear regression function. It is the value of the objective functions 𝐹𝐿𝑅 and 𝐹𝐿𝑅 and the elements of the 𝐴𝐿	𝑃𝐿 architecture of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) are the values of the objective functions 𝐹𝑃 and 𝐹𝑃 , respectively [3, 4]. 𝐴𝐿	𝑃𝐿 The simulation results show, neural network algorithms based on the DBN architecture with LR layers provide maximum accuracy in both indicators ( 𝐹𝐿𝑅 ∈ [97%, 98%] and 𝐹𝐿𝑅~98%, respectively) with  minimal  spread  (∆𝐹𝐿𝑅~2% and 𝐴𝐿 ∆𝐹𝐿𝑅~1%, respectively). 𝐴𝐿 The last group of neural network architectures, which was considered in this paper, includes such architectures as CNNs using a long chain of short-term memory elements (LSTM). The simulation results demonstrates, neural network algorithms based on the RNN architecture with the LSTM scheme provide maximum accuracy in both  indicators  (𝐹𝑅 ~96%  and  𝐹𝑅 ~96%,  respectively)  with  minimal  spread 𝐴𝐿	𝐴𝐿 (∆𝐹𝑅 ~1% and ∆𝐹𝑅 ~1%, respectively). 𝐴𝐿 𝑃𝐿 The main advantage of the particular scheme is the flexibility of convolutional operators in reducing the number of parameters. Such networks provide superior performance by simulating signals in temporal information and provide highly efficient detection of suspicious events using a long chain of short-term memory cells. As a result, the proposed approach can be adapted for a wide range of tasks in the field of organization, configuration and optimization of the SIEM scheme through the assessment of the accuracy of machine analysis in the selection and classification of cyber attack patterns according to a specific task (threat level, volume of incoming data flow and available computing resource and the memory resource of the hardware platform of the service).

57,New Approaches to Project Management and Related Digital Technologies with PMBOK 7 Edition,163,"Tsesliv O., Morozov V."," The Project Management Institute (PMI®) published the new PMBOK Guide Seventh Edition, on August 1, 2021. In six editions, the PMBOK had become larger and more elaborate – and therefore harder to read. Hence, the Seventh edition has aimed to give a fresh start and re-load the standard. The structure has also been changed. A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) is PMI’s fundamental PMI publication. The guide is a basic resource for effective project management in any industry. The book includes The Standard for Project Management. The standard is the foundation upon which the extended body of knowledge builds. The guide explains and summarizes that knowledge. Why isn't the PMBOK a methodology? It's important to highlight that, the PMBOK isn't a methodology. Considering it's widely followed, the PMBOK guide doesn't offer unique approaches for different types of projects and, it's a collection of best practices with general recommendations. A methodology is defined explicitly by a specific approach. And, as a result, it considers the oddity of a domain. However, the PMBOK and the guide it offers are a reference for several working methodologies in use today. What is changing in PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition PMBOK 7th Edition is based on principles rather than processes and it is much shorter than the 6th edition. In PMBOK 7th Edition, projects do not only produce products or deliverables. Projects deliver outcomes and these outcomes bring value to the organization and its stakeholders. There are 12 Project Delivery Principles and a Value Delivery System newly introduced in the 7th edition. The Value Delivery System is focusing on delivering valuable outcomes rather than deliverables. Projects are fundamental components of the Value Delivery System and principles guides the Project Managers, Team Members and stakeholders on how to achieve intended outcomes to deliver value to the organization and stakeholders. “Value Delivery System” approach Based on this system, the strategies, missions or objectives of an organization decides the next portfolios or investments. Portfolios can include sub-portfolios, programs or projects. To ensure the objectives of the portfolios, the program and project delivery must achieve its intended targets. Based on the outcomes of the projects, business impacts are analyzed and portfolios are reviewed or adjusted for the next steps. Once the projects are delivered successfully, expected business values must be achieved as well. This is called “Business Value Realization”. Based on the realized business values and outcomes of the delivered projects, organizations adjust their strategy to initiate new portfolios. Project teams can produce outcomes by using different delivery methodologies. For some projects, activities might be obvious and the results can be delivered by completing the activities. However, for other projects, there might be ongoing actions, monitoring and elaborating the outcomes of previous activities to determine the next steps in the project. The “project management” might not be an appropriate term for some projects. Therefore, “project delivery” is used instead of “project management” in PMBOK 7th edition to cover outcomes as well as deliverables of a project. Project Delivery Principles There are 12 principles in PMBOK 7th edition and these principles define the “what” and “why” of the project delivery. Project delivery principles describe a fundamental truth, norm, or value and are not prescriptive. To ensure the intended outcomes of the project delivery, project team members must follow these principles. The following are the 12 principles. Stewardship: Be a diligent, respectful, and caring steward. Team: Build a culture of accountability and respect. Stakeholders: Engage stakeholders to understand their interests and needs. Value: Focus on value. Holistic Thinking: Recognize and respond to systems’ interactions. Leadership: Motivate, influence, coach, and learn. Tailoring: Tailor the delivery approach based on context. Quality: Build quality into processes and results. Complexity: Address complexity using knowledge, experience, and learning. Opportunities & Threats: Address opportunities and threats. Adaptability & Resilience: Be adaptable and resilient. Change Management: Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state PMBOK Guide: The 8 New Project Performance Domains: The below-mentioned 8 Project Performance Domains can be considered as an alternative to the 5 Process Groups, though it does not come out neither is such correlation defined in the PMBOK 7. Stakeholder Team Development Approach and Life Cycle Planning Project Work Delivery Measurement Uncertainty Conclusion The biggest change is the shift from “process-based project management” to “principle-based project delivery”. Instead of processes, inputs, outputs, tools, and techniques, project delivery focuses on principles and outcomes. These changes continue the change of PMBOK from waterfall to agile methodologies, making PMBOK a more generic body of knowledge and showing PMI's effort to keep the leading positions in project management institutions.

58,Use of Artificial Intelligence Method to Optimize it Project Team Management Processes,165,"Vakulenko O., Timinskyi O."," Abstract. The integration of advanced technologies into management and decision-making procedures is a continuous effort toward projects performances optimization. Well prepared team with high professional knowledge and good communication inside is one of the main factors of successfully realized projects. The paper proposes and describes the process of developing and using Neural Networks (NNs) in order to optimize the management procedures of teams. The benefits of using artificial intelligence for management purposes showed by analyzing syntactic Human Resources (HR) data with R and Python languages and developing a neural model with the usage of the TensorFlow library. Keywords: Project management, team building, Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence. The search for better variants of business processes never stop, there is enough space for optimization. Today, Artificial intelligence (AI) optimization is becoming an essential topic in the business area as it might save human energy for a big number of tasks in any organization. This paper review how AI can help to optimize team management. The goal of project team management is to guarantee that project participants’ potential is utilized as effectively as possible. The efficiency of the team’s work will have a significant impact on the outcome of the company idea’s execution. The foundation for the project team’s efficiency is built at the time of its inception. However, even if the ideal team composition could be chosen, managing the team would not get any easier; on the contrary, it would become more challenging. Real specialists are considerably harder to handle than mediocre specialists [1]. They are more independent in their judgments, less disciplined, more ambitious, and are characterized by other characteristics that make the project manager's job more difficult. Burnout and the following dismissal of employees will affect the business even more. The projects of ex-employees might be delayed, and hiring new workers will take time and team resources from the project development. The majority of the time, new hires need to be taught for the position and/or given time to adjust to the organization. The business wants to determine what aspects impact the dismissal process the most in order to prevent it and save money. The logical step in this situation is to hire analysts in HR team, so they can analyze the data and control the employee aspects. It is hard to analyze large data manually, a lot of fields and their correlations might be confusing for the human eye. Using this approach analysts might build a lot of graphics, and lists of correlations on dependencies and then analyze them one by one. Does not sound like the best way to the improvement of team management. For purpose of example, a correlation matrix on IBM synthetical HR dataset is built [2]. From the dependency matrix (Figure 1) between attrition of employees and factors related to them, it is seen that ‘Age’, ‘Marital status’, ‘Total working years’, ‘Years at company’, and ‘Years with current manager’ impact the most the possibility of occupational burnout. Figure 1. Matrix of correlation between ‘Attrition’ and other factors. The matrix shows the general importance of different factors, but for proper analysis, it is important to create an individual chart for every factor. Without it, there is a chance that important information will be missed. It is even harder to calculate the possibility of burnout numerically. And this is a moment when we can turn to the help of AI. The system that builds on the Neural model with a continuously updating database of employees’ status will allow to check regularly the possibility of attrition on a daily/weekly/monthly base. The neural model might be trained on mentioned in this article previously synthetical data and then applied to the company database of employees and their factors shape. The neural model developed for this paper consists of the input layer with 19 neurons, 2 hidden layers with 8 and 5 neurons accordingly, and a single neuron layer output (Figure 2). Figure 2. Neural Networks model. The general accuracy of the model is 0.7, Precision is 0.6, Sensitivity is 0.7, and Specificity is 0.7 as well. Accuracy (all correct / all) = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) Precision (true positives / predicted positives) = TP / (TP + FP) Sensitivity aka Recall (true positives / all actual positives) = TP / (TP + FN) Specificity (true negatives / all actual negatives) =TN / (TN + FP) Conclusions: A neural network model can be used to enhance team management procedures and forecast the actual likelihood of staff attrition. By implementing it to ongoing data it is possible to predict how much the worker feel exhausted and which factor need to be reviewed. The use of artificial intelligence in managing IT project teams will help to mathematically determine the likelihood of employee burnout and the level of their motivation. This will reduce the risks of misunderstandings typical of the approach based on the intuition and feelings of the project manager or HR.

59,Unified Portal of Vacancies,168,"Vashchilin O., Vashchilinа O., Tumasonis R."," Abstract. Due to the armed military aggression in Ukraine, the problem of the population employment has become especially acute. Initiated by the Ministry of Economy and State Employment Service of Ukraine in corporation with leading jobs searching sites the “Unified Portal of Vacancies” - information environment for a job searching, was created. In this work are highlighted problematic questions that had to be solved at the start of this in-demand project. Features of aggregation of information from different sources and prospects of development are outlined. Keywords: job vacancies search, “Unified Portal of Vacancies”, information exchange, unified directory, profession classifier. Due to the war, many Ukrainians lost their works. So, looking for a job is a very urgent problem today. It is especially difficult for those who were forced to move to a different region of Ukraine due to the hostilities. At the same time, businesses that have changed their location because of the war, as well as enterprises that are opening or expanding, especially with the help of grant programs from the State for starting or developing a business [1], need labor. It is possible to provide Ukrainians with work in wartime only by combining the efforts of all interested parties - the State, business and job seekers. So, the State Employment Service with the participation of the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine, as the organizer, signed an agreement on cooperation and information interaction with leading work searching sites: work.ua, robota.ua, grc.ua, novarobota.ua, pidbir.com. As a result of such cooperation, the ""Unified Portal of Vacancies"" [2] was created, which began а work on September 20, 2022. The ""Unified Portal of Vacancies"" allows you to find information about jobs based on the region (area, district, community), a field of work, expected salary level, and type of employment. Vacancies are updated on the portal several times a day. Brief information about the vacancy is displayed in an easy-to-view form, with subsequent redirection for additional information and contacts to the site that provided the vacancy (work.ua, robota.ua, grc.ua, novarobota.ua, pidbir.com, dcz.gov.ua). The portal is adapted to work from any mobile device. Currently, the portal contains more than 120 thousand vacancies. The portal is daily used by thousands of users that generate several tens of thousands of job search queries. The portal technically is implemented using technologies: React, Node.js, Python. An object-relational database management system – PostgreSQL is used as a database server. Information is exchanged through the API interface in json and xml formats. At the start of the project development, we had to solve several problematic issues. Each of the leading Ukrainian sites for searching for a job has certain peculiarities in the business logic implementation of its software, specifically in the exchange of regulatory and reference information. First of all, the list of data on vacancies that all project participants are ready to provide was agreed upon. In this regard, at the first stage, a simplified algorithm for combining data is used to bring data to the state classifier of objects of the administrative-territorial structure of Ukraine [3] and a unified list of industries or areas of activity of enterprises. Description of information aggregation from different sites: first receiving directories (regions, settlements, branches of activity of enterprises, business entities) from leading job search sites. Bringing these directories to the unified directories. repeatedly obtaining these directories, when changes were made. Bringing changes in these directories to the united unified directories. daily receiving information about vacancies. Several times a day. Check for compliance of the provided vacancies with the unified directories. If there is such compliance - vacancies are added to the unified database of vacancies. If there is no match - manual processing is applied (reconciliation with sites, updating directories, etc.). Figure 1 - Scheme of information exchange between project participants Development prospects: unification of vacancies and possibly bringing them into line with the national classification of professions of Ukraine ""DK 003:2010"" [4], in particular with the use of artificial intelligence; subscription for users for selection and distribution of vacancies; application of artificial intelligence for searching and selecting vacancies; implementation of a mobile application; search and selection of vacancies via Viber and Telegram bot; the possibility of searching and selecting vacancies using the portal and mobile application ""Diya"". The scheme of information exchange between the project participants concerning future tasks is shown in Figure 1. So, providing Ukrainians with jobs during the war is possible only through joint efforts of all interested parties - the State, business and job seekers. A powerful information environment for job search as the ""Unified Portal of Vacancies"" will help in overcoming unfavorable tendencies in the labor market by optimizing the process of legal job search. Proper provision of enterprises with employees will contribute to the recovery and future development of Ukraine's economy.

60,Classification of Cloud Types on Satellite Images Using Deep Learning,171,"Vasylieva A., Melnyk R."," Abstract. Cloud types classification is a kind of image classification problem, which can be solved using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and artificial neural networks. In this research, the convolutional neural network was proposed to classify cloud images captured by the NOAA-20 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite. CNN model successfully classifies four cloud types: Cirrus, Cumulonimbus, Cumulus, and Stratocumulus. Experiment results show that the proposed method has better accuracy of cloud classification than other machine learning methods, such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Trees algorithms. Keywords: satellite imagery, cloud classification, convolutional neural network. Introduction. Today, cloud recognition and interpretation using satellite cloud imagery play a significant role in meteorological monitoring, climate, and weather forecasting. Manual cloud interpretation is used to solve the problem of classification of cloud images. But this method has certain disadvantages related to the quality of human recognition of cloud images and the complex and time-consuming processing of large data sets. Therefore, suitable approaches to solving this problem are supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and artificial neural networks [1]. The purposes of the research are analyzing existing deep learning methods for image recognition and processing, creating an artificial neural network for cloud classification based on satellite images, and estimating its accuracy. Practical implementation. The EarthData service [2] was chosen for uploading and processing satellite images of clouds, which allows you to receive an image captured by the NOAA-20 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite, which collects data by combining visible and infrared spectral ranges. To solve the problem of classification of cloud types on satellite images, a set of cloud images in RGB format of different sizes, belonging to the following four classes, was prepared: Cirrus, Cumulonimbus, Cumulus, and Stratocumulus. A proposed convolutional neural network model accepts as input images of given classes with a size of 160 x 160 x 3, where 160 x 160 is the size of the image, and 3 is the number of channels (red, green, blue). The model consists of 4 combinations of convolutional and aggregating layers with the ReLU activation function and a fully connected layer with the Softmax activation function, which is usually used in the last levels of multiclass classification, because this function considers all the values from the previous network layer, which allows you to calculate the probability for each class [3]. During model training, the cross-entropy function, as a loss function, was used to calculate the difference between the value of the training data and the predicted results. For optimization, the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) was chosen, which is a combination of the RMSprop algorithm and stochastic gradient descent [4]. The cloud image classification results, namely the actual cloud class and the predicted one, are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 - Cloud classification results After evaluating the accuracy of the model on test images, the results of the proposed convolutional neural network were compared with other image classification methods (Table 1).

61,"А Collaboration Model for Creating an Innovative Pedagogical Product Using the ""Inschool"" Web Platform",173,"Vedmid S., Timinskyi O.",". Abstract. In the real world, such qualities as a talented teacher-teacher, a scientist-professional in the development of educational and pedagogical product and a professional bearer of unique knowledge and skills are very rarely present together in one person. These are always different people and our goal is to make sure that they can meet and together create a unique innovative educational and pedagogical product that will help students to get modern, innovative, and unique knowledge and skills. Keywords: Innovative pedagogical product, collaboration, web platform, concept, inSchool, out-of-school education. Introduction Sixty five percent of children starting primary school today will enter into jobs that do not currently exist [1]. In an era of multiple labor market disruptions – wars, pandemics, supply chain changes, green transitions, technological transformation – the one type of investment that all governments and businesses can make is investing in education, reskilling, and upskilling. This is the best way to expand opportunities, increase social mobility and accelerate growth. A single $1 investment in a child’s education yields as much as $5 in returns over a lifetime. An additional year of education on average translates to 9% higher lifetime earnings, and in some cases up to 15% higher. The returns in lower-income countries are even higher than those in higher-income countries [2]. That is why for Ukraine, investments in children's education have not only social but also economic significance. Undoubtedly, investments in innovative and unique education will bring a more tangible result from the point of view of the future. But when we talk about innovative education, we must understand that innovative education is the result of the development of science and technology, in which we as a country lag behind in many areas. In the real world, such qualities as a talented teacher-teacher, a scientist- professional in the development of educational and pedagogical content, and a professional bearer of unique knowledge and skills are very rarely present together in one person. These are always different people and our goal is to make sure that they meet and together create a unique innovative educational and pedagogical product that will help students (primarily children) to get modern, innovative, and unique knowledge. To solve this problem, an experimental solution for the creation of innovative and unique educational and pedagogical products is proposed - the collaboration module. Concept. The main goal of the development of the collaboration module for the creation of an innovative pedagogical product is to offer a complex IT solution in the form of a separate web platform interface for the joint design, testing, and improvement of a pedagogical product by several participants. The interface will offer the following roles and their functions: Teacher methodologist is a carrier of knowledge, skills, and techniques for creating, monitoring, and improving educational and pedagogical products. A professional teacher is also a carrier of knowledge and skills for effective teaching and learning and monitoring the progress of students. Occupation professional is a carrier and author of unique and innovative knowledge and skills in certain professional areas. He is not a teacher and does not have the skills to create an educational-pedagogical product, but he is a carrier of educational content and skills that, in the process of collaboration with a teacher, form the basis of an educational-pedagogical product. The group of student testers is a number of students, users of the platform, who are interested in acquiring relevant skills or knowledge and voluntarily participate in the study (testing) of the educational and pedagogical context, which was created as a result of the collaboration of the ""Methodist Pedagogue"" and the ""Professional"". They give feedback in the form of passing tests or exams on the knowledge or skills they have learned. A teacher is a carrier of effective methods of group and individual training, who has undergone preliminary training on teaching a new educational and pedagogical product and will teach and train students (platform users), collect feedback, and pass it on to the development team. A student is a consumer of an educational product – a user, a student of an educational platform (a child or parent, an adult student) who undergoes training in acquiring knowledge and training in mastering skills according to a developed educational and pedagogical product. Stage 1 – product request. A potential ""Learner"" from the system's existing ""skill tree"" or ""catalog of knowledge groups"" chooses the one they would like to develop or explore. If the system does not find a suitable educational and pedagogical product and teacher - a request is generated, which the potential consumer approves. After that, the system sends an invitation to other potential consumers with similar interests to join the request. If, as a result of these invitations, a group of students with a number of at least 50 users will be formed, the system registers a ""Passive product request"". In order to activate this request, the system automatically generates a fundraising procedure. Stage 2 – the creation of a team for the development of an innovative educational and pedagogical product. After the successful completion of the fundraising procedure, the system sends an invitation to participate in the development of a new educational product to ""Professionals"" who have proven skills, as well as to ""Methodologists"" who are accordingly registered in the system. The team is considered created if an agreement is reached and a corresponding smart contract is generated - the minimum number of members of the development team is three ""Professionals"" and three ""Teacher methodologists"". Pic.1. The process of collaboration to create an innovative pedagogical product. Stage 3 – development and testing. The development team begins to work on the creation of an educational and pedagogical product. At this time, the system creates a ""Group of testers"" by selecting ""students"" from among those who took part in fundraising and who already have experience or can perform the role of ""testers"" based on their set of skills. The process of development and testing takes place in a consistent iterative order - when, after the presentation of the educational content, the ""Methodists-pedagogues"" receive feedback from the ""Group of testers"" and process it - they make appropriate changes to the pedagogical product together with the ""Professionals"" Stage 4 – training of ""Teachers"". After the completion of development and testing, the Development Team initiates the training procedure for ""teachers"". After receiving a corresponding request, the system selects teachers based on the geographical principle and criteria set by the development team and invites them to undergo training. According to the results of the training, ""teachers"" also have the opportunity to provide feedback to the team and influence the results. Stage 5 – finalization of the educational and pedagogical product. At this stage, the system sends a message to all ""students"" who participated in fundraising that the educational and pedagogical product they ordered is ready and they are invited to start studying and training. Also, in the process of this training, the ""teachers"" are expected to collect feedback and feedback from the students and pass it on to the development team. The product is considered finalized as a result of the successful training of more than 50% of students who participated in the fundraising An important note - in the smart contract regarding the intellectual property of the educational and pedagogical product, the development team can, at its own request, specify who will be additionally entitled to a profit bonus (it can also be testers, teachers, and even students who participated in fundraising and final testing). The size of the ""Teachers"" bonus is also regulated by the smart contract. The system will distribute profits according to the smart contract and after confirmation of receipt of services by the ""students"". Conclusion. As a result of the research, a theoretical model and a set of tools were proposed for establishing interaction between all participants in the development, testing, and improvement of an innovative educational and pedagogical product. This model is planned for implementation on the ""inSchool"" platform for the organization of children's out-of-school education. It is expected that the successful implementation of both the model and the platform as a whole will allow the development of the after-school education market of Ukraine in the conditions of a pandemic, war, and forced migration, will create additional jobs and offer prospects to talented professionals, teachers, children, and adults.

62,A Study of the Modern Approach to the Development of Android Applications in the Kotlin Language Using the Jetpack Compose Framework,177,"Zhylka I., Selivyorstova T., Kaliberda Yu."," Abstract. The work is devoted to comparing the display speed of two UI interfaces, one of which was written using a new framework from Google - Jetpack Compose, and the other using xml files. Parameters such as Frozen Frames, Slow Frames, and full screen display speed were taken as the main metrics. according to the test results, it was determined that the new framework, in addition to its advantages, has a significant drawback that must be taken into account when switching to Jetpack Compose. Keywords: Android, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Google, Rendering Research, UI Components, Imperative type of programming. Introduction. Thanks to the rapid development of the mobile industry, every few years the world sees the emergence of new technical solutions designed to make life easier for developers. Declarative UI has probably become the main trend in mobile development over the past few years. Such a solution has long been successfully used in the Internet and cross-platform solutions, and finally began to be used in native development. For the implementation of which there is SwiftUI (presented at WWDC 2019) on iOS, and Jetpack Compose (presented a month earlier at Google I/O 2019) on Android. Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit from Google for creating Android applications using the Kotlin programming language. Jetpack Compose simplifies writing and updating an application's visual interface by providing a declarative approach [1]. It is known that declarative programming is a programming paradigm in which the programmer defines what the program should do without specifying how it should be implemented. In other words, the approach focuses on what needs to be achieved rather than teaching how to achieve it. In contrast to it, the imperative method is a method of authoritative prescriptions (orders), which is based on relations of subordination (subordination) of some subjects to others [4]. A clear example of this approach is the description of the necessary graphic components in xml files. Therefore, the task of studying and analyzing the modern approach to developing Android applications in the Kotlin language using the Jetpack Compose framework is relevant. The purpose of the work is to study the display metrics of UI mobile applications by comparing the test results obtained using open APIs. Jetpack Compose Review. The main feature of Jetpack Compose is the declarative style of creating UI. At the same time, the description of the interface looks like a set of componable functions - widgets that are not used under the hood of a view, but directly deal with the display on the canvas. It should be noted that at the moment the declarative style of UI development is not a widespread and popular business, but the number of projects using Jetpack Compose is constantly growing. The main advantages of Jetpack Compose, in contrast to the existing Android UI framework, are the following [2]: Unbundled toolkit: Jetpack Compose does not depend on specific platform releases; You no longer need to switch between classes and xml files, all work with the UI takes place in one Kotlin file. Composite approach: no inheritance. Each UI component performs an ordinary composable function, which is responsible for only limited functionality, i.e., without unnecessary logic. Backward compatibility: You don't need to start a project from scratch to use Compose. It is possible to embed it (using ComposeView) into an existing XML layout, and vice versa. Support by giant corporations. Less code Rendering test for UI display. The following parameters were selected as important metrics for displaying the UI of mobile applications: Frozen Frames – interface objects whose visualization takes more than 700 ms; Slow Frames – interface objects whose visualization takes more than 16 ms; Page Load Duration – page display speed. The study of the display parameters of the UI of mobile applications was carried out using the FrameMetricsAggregator API, taking into account the life cycles of the application. The ""Flashlight"" application was chosen as a test, the UI of which was developed using Jetpack Compose (Figure 1.1) and using the standard approach - through an xml page (Figure 1.2). Testing made it possible to compare the display speed of widgets written in different ways (Figure 1.3) [3]. Table 1 – Widget display metrics Looking at the results, we can draw the following conclusions that Jetpack Compose at this stage of its existence loses to the standard approach in terms of page load speed, this is due to the fact that most components used for XML-based layouts are compiled in advance, while Compose components, as well as the code, are compiled in Runtime mode. Because build components are ungrouped on the fly, rendering the layout can take a significant amount of time. But on the plus side, Jetpack Compose has its own performance benefits as more and more components are interpreted ahead of time. Not only focusing on productivity, Jetpack compose has also improved development acceleration by providing modular and intuitive declarative APIs.

63,Development and Research of the Intelligent Technology for Predicting the Popularity of Animals From the Shelter,6,"Antonevych M., Snytyuk V."," Abstract. Millions of stray animals are injured on the streets every day around the world. So, what can be done, to help these animals to get new home? Scientists and researchers can suggest improvements that will help shelter animals to have a higher chance to be adopted with the help of data science. One of the solutions for this problem can be called one that will also use artificial intelligence. We intend to use a computer vision apparatus based on neural networks. Keywords: Computer vision, prediction, intelligent technology, artificial intelligence, neural networks, deep learning, data science, shelter animals Introduction. Millions of stray animals are injured on the streets every day around the world [1]. Such animals feel alone and they cannot live happy and healthy life. It is a great problem that so many animals cannot find their loving homes. In addition, these animals face many problems during their life in shelters. As example, for most dogs, being relinquished to an animal shelter is a drastic change and a very stressful experience [2]. Such environmental changes are very stressful for the most of dogs. Stress may also affect a shelter dog’s physical health, causing increased susceptibility to diseases and a longer recovery time from illness [2]. And all of them need love and a cozy home. So, what can be done, to help these animals to get new home? One picture is worth a thousand words and the photography can save thousand lives. It is obvious that pets with charming photos can generate more interest and they can be adopted faster [1]. Scientists and researchers can determine the appeal of pet pictures. Moreover, they can suggest improvements that will help shelter animals to have a higher chance to be adopted with the help of data science. There are many animal shelters & organizations that help animals to get their new loving homes all over the word. For example, “PetFinder.my” is Malaysia's leading animal welfare platform with over 180000 animals, 54000 of which have been safely adopted [1]. “PetFinder” works closely with animal lovers, the media, corporations and international organizations that help to improve animal welfare [1]. Moreover, they have launched Kaggle Competition on the 23rd of September, 2021. That’s why it is new to the world. Their aim is to help shelter animals to get their new home with the help of data science. Problem Formulation. As it Kaggle Competition, the given problem is posted on the site kaggle.com [1]. The task is to predict engagement with a pet's profile based on the photography for that profile. Therefore, our aim is to analyze raw images and metadata and, after that, create intelligent technology that will be able to predict the “pawpularity” of pet photos. Dataset. As it said in [1], the data can be used for academic research and education. In addition, the owners of the task have included optional Photo Metadata, manually labeling each photo for key visual quality and composition parameters. These labels are not used for deriving their “pawpularity” score, but it may be beneficial for better understanding the content and co-relating to a photo's attractiveness. The example of images is given in Fig.1. Figure 1 - Dataset Previous Decisions Achieved. “PetFinder.my” currently uses a basic attraction counter for ranking pet photos. It analyzes image composition and other factors based on characteristics of thousands of pet profiles. The “pawpularity” score is derived from each pet profile's page view statistics at the listing pages, using the algorithm that normalizes the traffic data across different pages, platforms (web & mobile) and other various metrics. While this basic tool is useful, it is still in an experimental stage and the algorithm could be improved [1]. Offered Approach. One of the proposed solutions for this problem can be called the one that will use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. As we have images in the dataset, so the solution belongs to the domain of the computer vision (CV) problems. CV is a field of AI that enables computers and systems to derive important information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, CV enables them to see, observe and understand [3]. For example, CV consists of such tasks as image processing, object detection, image recognition, image segmentation and so on. Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it [4]. Object detection is a CV technique that allows to locate objects in an image or video. With this kind of identification and localization, object detection can be used to count objects in a scene and determine and track their precise locations, all while accurately labeling them [5]. Image recognition, in the context of machine vision, is the ability of software to identify objects in images [6]. Image segmentation is a method in which a digital image is broken down into various subgroups called “image segments” which helps in reducing the complexity of the image to make further processing or analysis of the image simpler. Segmentation in easy words is assigning labels to pixels. All picture elements or pixels belonging to the same category have a common label assigned to them [7]. All these tasks can be solved using such methods as: basic morphology operations (erosion, dilation, opening, closing etc.); machine learning methods (e.g. image segmentation can be done with the help of clustering methods [8], such as K- Means or evolutionary methods like genetic algorithms, MODS etc.); deep learning methods (e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks). Therefore, we intend to use a computer vision apparatus based on neural networks for predicting the floating value of the “pawpularity” score.

64,Identification of Critical Information Infrastructure Objects,9,"Antoniuk V., Parkhomenko I."," Abstract. To date, natural and man-made threats, the level of terrorism, the scale and complexity of cyberattacks have increased significantly. And the number of cyberattacks aimed at impressing various areas of critical infrastructure is growing steadily. These situations have increased the urgency of the problem of protection of critical infrastructure, especially information and communication technologies, which are strategically important for the existence and functioning of our state, as well as ensuring the security of the Ukrainian people. In addition, disruption of such facilities can lead to economic and social collapse of the state. Keywords: critical infrastructure, critical infrastructure objects, critical information infrastructure, identification of critical information infrastructure objects. The number of cyberattacks affecting critical infrastructure (CI) is growing every day. One of the recent attacks is the Petya virus, which has invaded the banking sector. These situations have increased the urgency of the problem of protection of CI facilities, which are strategically important for the existence and functioning of our state, as well as ensuring the security of the Ukrainian people. In Ukrainian legislation, the term critical infrastructure (CI) is understood as a set of state infrastructure facilities that are most important for the economy and industry, the functioning of society and public safety and the decommissioning or destruction of which may affect national security and defense, natural environment, lead to significant financial losses and human casualties. Objects of CI are enterprises and institutions (regardless of ownership) of such industries as energy, chemical industry, transport, banks and finance, information technology and telecommunications (electronic communications), food, health care, utilities, which are strategically important for the functioning of the economy and security of the state, society and population [1]. The document [2] introduces new concepts of ""critical information infrastructure"" (CII) and is interpreted as ""a set of critical information infrastructure"" and ""critical information infrastructure"", which reveals more clearly the previous term, and means communication or technological system of a critical infrastructure object, a cyberattack which will directly affect the sustainable functioning of such a critical infrastructure object ”. The source of threats is not only the unsatisfactory condition of infrastructure networks (their high wear, accidents) and the impact of natural factors (karst, landslides, flooding, etc.), but also a set of economic factors manifested by the lack of interest operators of such networks to improve the situation. In general, this affects the inefficient management of critical infrastructure security, in particular life support systems. Thus, there is a significant threat of termination of the provision of vital services to the population due to unresolved issues of settlements between infrastructure network operators and their suppliers. The group of malicious actions also includes threats posed by intelligence services of other countries on the territory of Ukraine, aimed at damaging critical infrastructure [3]. There are currently several issues that need to be addressed immediately for the development of CI facilities: Lack of an integrated system of CI protection; Inferiority of the regulatory framework, especially the law on CI and protection of its objects; The absence of a separate body of state power that is responsible for actions in the field of CI; Uncertainty of general criteria and methods for identification and threat assessment of CI objects; Lack of international cooperation and public-private partnership. The first step in solving problems can be to create a list of CII objects that cannot be created without identifying them. Under the identification of the object of critical information infrastructure is understood the procedure of assigning the object of information infrastructure to the objects of critical information infrastructure [4]. Therefore, research in the field of detection and protection of critical infrastructure from cyber threats is relevant and necessary. That is why there is a need to develop a method of identification of critical information infrastructure, which will allow the identification of critical objects of a particular industry and determine the degree of their criticality, which systematizes critical infrastructure and facilitate the choice of means and ways to protect them from threats.

Reporting the relevance of the application of opportunities, modern analytics technologies in e-commerce projects. The classification model for the online store has been developed. The model is based on the method of k-nearest neighbors. There are 4 classes of customers: customers with numerous transactions compared to other customers, regular customers, customers who made their transactions much earlier than other customers, regular customers with medium and low check amounts. Keywords: e-commerce, data analysis, k-nearest neighbors method. E-commerce has become commonplace for most Ukrainians and residents of other civilized countries [1]. This is due to the development of information technology, which causes a ""low threshold of entry"" into E-commerce. You can quickly, inexpensively and independently create a full-fledged site, set up online advertising and start earning. To run an effective online business, it is necessary to properly analyze the data generated in the process of conducting e-business to plan a business development strategy, optimize processes and increase profits. An online store dataset was chosen for the research [2]. It is appropriate to collect data using web analytics tools. The purpose of this study is to cluster the customer base of the online store based on a synthetic dataset. RFM-analysis is often used for this purpose - customer segmentation in the analysis of sales by loyalty, which defines three groups: Recency - how recently did the customer purchase? - prescription of the transaction, the less time has passed since the last activity of the client, the greater the probability that he will repeat the action Frequency - how often do they purchase? - the number of transactions, the more actions the client performs, the more likely it is that he will repeat them in the future Monetary Value - how much do they spend? - the amount of transactions, the more money was spent, the more likely it is that he will place an order [3]. Using the method of k-nearest neighbors - a simple non-parametric method of classification, in which the distance to all other objects (usually Euclidean) is used to classify objects in the attribute space [4] - we can create a mathematical model for clustering existing and future customers. Attribute characteristics selected: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country. After the process of data cleaning and verification in accordance with the methodology of using the method of k-nearest neighbors, three additional attributes were created and normalized: Review, Frequency, Monetary and their values were calculated based on data from the dataset. After all the procedures at the output we get a table with the results of clustering (Fig. 1) Figure 1 – Clustering results table [5] Based on the result of clustering, the following conclusions are made: Clients with Cluster ID 0 are clients with many transactions compared to other clients. Customers with Cluster ID 0 are regular customers. Cluster ID 2 - customers made their transactions much earlier than other customers. Customers with Cluster ID 1 are regular customers with medium and low check amounts. Based on these findings, the online store can optimize current activities and adjust the development strategy.

66,Decentralized Network in IoT Systems,13,"Bidochka V., Paliy S."," Keywords: IoT, decentralized networks, centralized networks, networks, P2P. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects — “things” — that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. IoT systems are becoming more and more popular these days. They are used in different ways and do different tasks. There’s a lot of noise at the moment about the Internet of Things (or IoT) and its impact on everything from the way we travel and do our shopping to the way manufacturers keep track of inventory. Due to the impetuous growth of their popularity in IoT systems, there are a lot of problems and shortcomings. From them, it is possible to allocate the following: weak data integrity; no one can guarantee the anonymity of the data; data is not protected from change. To solve these problems it is offered to create IoT systems that are based on decentralized networks. Materials and methods of research The materials of this research were the experience of developing centralized and decentralized networks by IT companies and also articles comparing these two types of networks. The methods of the research are comparing types of networks in terms of practicality, cost and also security. The important factor of comparing these two types was the ability of maximum compatibility of the network type with all the specifics of IoT systems in particular the speed of processing, reading and forwarding data, also the highest degree of data resistance to change. Results and discussion The simplest implementations of two types of networks were derived: centralized at Figure 1 and decentralized at Figure 2. Ways of their implementation, in particular methods of achieving user anonymity, compliance with the integrity, immutability and anonymity of data. And also the comparative table of qualities of two types of networks were received (Table 1). Table 1 Comparative of qualities of two types of networks There were selected optimal technologies for developing software and based on described research was developed IoT system that consists of: NHS-server - the server that is used for checking which devices are active, checking that two or more devices not using the same certificate, getting the best suitable devices for sending and saving data for the requested device based on special metrics, created with Python 3; Devices Certification Server - server that is used for saving device certificate and realizing auth functionality, created with Python 3; Backend API - service that is used for communicating with web app and hub, created with Python 3; Hardware SDK - software development kit that is used for developing hardware firmware and that consist of based API methods for communicating with a decentralized network, created using C++; Node Software - software that is running on the everyone node of the network and realizing API for communicating with other nodes and NHS-server, created using Python 3; Web App - web interface for displaying all required data from all sensors in the local user area, created using JavaScript and Svelte. Conclusion A study was conducted to determine the advantages of using decentralized networks over centralized networks for their use in IoT projects. On the basis of the conducted research the prototype of an IoT system with all auxiliary microservices on the basis of the decentralized network is constructed.

67,BadUSB: Overview of the Possible Attacks With the Usage of Arduino Board,16,"Buchyk S., Kosse A."," Abstract. The introduced work covers the most feasible attacks that can be executed against the personal computers that have been left unblocked. As in most other cases: badUSB attacks still requires a lot of social engineering to work properly. Keywords: BadUSB, Arduino, HID attack, Kali Linux. Over the years, social engineering and the use of USB sticks for an attack have shown to be quite effective. People have been repeatedly warned not to connect mass storage devices that they have not acquired themselves. Computer defenses are developed to protect a system from USB attacks. Computers, on the other hand, require keyboards and frequently do not regard the keyboard as an attacking instrument. As a result, a system can be exploited using a USB (badUSB) masquerading as a human interface device (such as a keyboard). BadUSB is an attack that takes advantage of a flaw in USB firmware. A USB device is reprogrammed to act as a human interface device in this attack, and the USB device is then used to silently execute instructions or launch malicious applications on the victim’s computer. Security researchers Karsten Nohl and Jakob Lell originally identified and revealed the BadUSB attack at the 2014 Black Hat conference [1]. The BadUSB code is presently available to the public via Github [2], which means that anybody may launch a full-fledged BadUSB assault, even if they have little or no experience. Phison 2303 was the most popular USB storage chip at the time of its discovery. It was also vulnerable to being reprogrammed and used as a HID device. However, the chip was eventually abandoned, and several manufacturers addressed the flaw in following production lines. The threat of badUSB attacks is at an all-time high, because to the growing popularity of Arduino boards. And, as a result of the vast array of options available on these boards, the attack vectors associated with their use have skyrocketed. An employee can leave the computer alone for a brief printing job or a cup of coffee. This gives the attacker or penetration tester a window of opportunity to launch an assault. The Arduino only has a limited amount of memory. As a result, downloading and executing a file can increase the attack’s efficacy. FTP and HTTP are two methods for downloading files on a Windows 10 computer. The Windows Firewall blocks FTP by default. The download of a malicious file through HTTP creates a security risk to the attack server since the file must be hosted publicly, allowing anybody to view it and attempt to hack the attacker system. In order to protect both the attack server and the client, a third solution is used. On the victim, HTTP is used to download Secure FTP (SFTP) client (PSFTP) and securely log in to a remote machine and get the .exe file. SFTP requires the SSH service to be started on the remote machine and that there is an account that permits SSH. A good practice is to limit the capabilities of accessing this account [3]. The malicious executable file may be downloaded using Windows Powershell and saved in a folder to which the user has write and execute permissions. ’C:\Users\[Currentuser]\’ is one example. The environment variable USEPROFILE can also be used to access the user directory. Setting up remote control provides up a lot of possibilities for an assault. Remote access, unlike the Arduino’s timing constraint, gives the hacker or pen-tester enough time to compromise the system. If the remote connection is to a Kali Linux system, all of the Kali Linux exploits may be remotely tested on the victim. A possibility is to use Meterpreter [4] exploits, such as reverse TCP. Reverse TCP is a con- nection that begins on the victim’s computer and ends on the hacker’s machine. Because the connection is outgoing (from the perspective of the victim), incoming traffic firewall or router filters are bypassed. Filtering outgoing traffic is difficult, especially when personal computers are utilized. On Windows 8.1, and Windows 10, there aren’t many privilege escalation vulnerabilities or exploits. Local privilege escalation is conceivable, but it’s not practical because it requires the user to have registry editing permissions, and if they’re not removed correctly, the device is left vulnerable. Kali Linux comes with a pre-installed version of mitmproxy [5]. Mitmproxy allows you to intercept, alter, and replay HTTP(S) traffic. On the fly, it produces fraudulent SSL certificates. It also creates a forgery of the root certificate. If the victim’s computer has that certificate installed, the browser will not provide a warning and will trust it, typically displaying traffic within the SSL tunnel on the proxy machine. The command line program Certmgr may be used to install a certificate on a Windows PC. Keyloggers, often known as keystroke loggers, are programs that record the keys that are pressed on a keyboard. It is a method of secretly monitoring what a person types, generally without the individual’s awareness. There are two methods that are thought to be viable: installing using Arduino or utilizing it from Kali. Physical hardware keyloggers are not considered since they are ineffective and easily detectable. Because keylogger software is frequently detected and blocked by antivirus software or intrusion detection systems, installing it from the Arduino is also not possible. On an exploited machine with remote access session, Kali Linux provides the keyscan tool [6]. This tool makes keystroke recording a feasible attack for implementation with Arduino. Persistent backdoors allow access to machines that have been previously compromised. Penetrating the system can be stopped if patches are applied or the machine is simply rebooted if this stage is skipped. Metsvc and persistence.rb are two Kali Linux solutions to examine (a Meterpreter script). Metsvc operates as a service, whereas Persistence begins when the user signs in or when the system boots. Both backdoors constitute security risks for the system they’re installed on, thus they should be deleted once the penetration test is through. It is a recommended practice to ’disguise’ the exploit as another process in order to keep it undiscovered. This is accomplished by moving the process to another process (using the migrate Kali Linux tool). Because the assault is identified as a job of the operating system, it is difficult to detect. The process ’explorer’, for example, can be migrated using the existing user permissions. With elevated rights, it is also possible to migrate to the Windows Login Process (winlogon), so that the attack is executed for every user that logs in [7]. Amongst the reviewed attack vectors there are a few that are feasible for the successful execution in the current state of antivirus protection: file download using keyboard only, persistent backdoor and remote access. However, there are a lot more possibilities to develop the badUSB itself, besides using the pure Arduino board. Amongst them are: constructing Arduino with GSM or WiFi module for remote control, storing execution code directly on the phone and tricking the victim to plug it in. And combining with the mentioned attacks above it can become a serious threat even to the most secure system. But this options are left for the future investigation.

68,Phishing Detection Based on Unsupervised Learning Method,19,"Buchyk S., Piatashova E."," Abstract. Machine learning is widely used in the modern world to identify various forms of cyber-attacks. The issue is that typical machine learning methods may experience performance loss in these contexts due to their non-stationary nature. Due to the fact that traditional supervised machine learning-based phishing site detection approaches also suffer from these limitations, we propose in this study to employ a more holistic mode of scientific inquiry known as fuzzy clustering in the phishing sites detection. Keywords: Fuzzy clustering technique, phishing detection, machine learning. Today, the Internet is pervasive, and society relies heavily on web services for a variety of purposes. Simultaneously, malicious websites pose a significant threat to Internet users, and unaware users can become victims of malicious URLs that host undesirable content such as phishing and spam. Phishing is a form of identity theft that occurs when a malicious Web site impersonates a legitimate one in order to acquire sensitive information such as passwords, account details, or credit card numbers [1]. There are two primary methods for detecting phishing attacks: user training and software classification. Users can be trained to recognize phishing and real sites by understanding the nature of phishing assaults. Software classification seeks to classify phishing and authentic sites more precisely and decreases human error or ignorance. In terms of software classification, it is obvious from the black lists of phishing websites that phishing links have a tendency to register domains for a brief period of time. For instance, the majority of phishing domains were registered for one year, in contrast to benign domains, which are typically registered for ten years or longer. Concerning the secure connection, the vast majority of phishing links do not use the HTTPS protocol, making it a critical criterion for detecting phishing. Geolocation of domain registrars and hosting servers can also be considered when large samples are used. As a result, the following attributes may be considered when evaluating the task of detecting phishing links: domain registrar, domain registration period, hosting server geolocation, and secure connection with a valid certificate. With such a database of malicious and benign websites, the task of detecting phishing links is typically accomplished through the use of a binary classifier. It is sufficient to employ conventional categorization techniques or to develop a grading system based on the statistical distribution of qualities between the two classes of links and on expert assessment. This type of machine learning is referred to supervised learning, because there is a data that is well labeled. However, there is another method, called unsupervised learning, which despite its low accuracy, is now the most promising area of scientific research. Such models do not require labeled data and therefore have great potential for application, notably in the realm of cybersecurity. Among the unsupervised learning techniques there is a fuzzy clustering, which is a technique for grouping multidimensional objects that is based on presenting the results of individual observations as points in a suitable geometric space and then selecting groupings as ""clusters"" of these points. Thus, the main purpose of the analysis is to select in the original multidimensional data such homogeneous subsets so that the objects within the groups are similar to each other, and the objects from different groups are not similar. ""Similarity"" means the proximity of objects in a multidimensional space of features. Then the problem is reduced to the selection in this space of natural clusters of objects, which are considered homogeneous groups [2]. The article [3], represents an examining of Twitter posts to identify the leaders of terrorist networks and their followers based on fuzzy clustering. A big data architecture is provided for categorizing people based on their activity, ability to influence other users, and message content. The authors used graphs to examine how messages propagate over the network, and fuzzy clustering techniques to classify people into profiles, which is the proof that unsupervised learning can be used to detect phishing sites. We propose to consider fuzzy clustering algorithm as a way of phishing sites detection. As future work, we are researching on the effectiveness of fuzzy clustering of indicators of compromise to detect phishing sites. In this method, indicators of compromise exemplify a clustering feature. Not only indicators of a compromise are quantitative, but there are also qualitative indicators, for that reason fuzzy clustering is applicable.

69,Password Complexity Analysis of Diceware Password Generation Algorithm Modification Based on Pseudo-Random Sequences,21,"Buchyk S., Piatyhor V."," Abstract: The authors investigated main algorithms for generating passwords that exist in the market and analysed their advantages and disadvantages. The complexity of the generated passwords was estimated based on the finite entropy and the complexity of memorization. The resistance of the password to brute force attacks and dictionary attacks was also evaluated. A modified algorithm for generating Diceware passwords is recommended to use instead of the original one due to the higher entropy of the former. Keywords: password authentication, password, password generation, Diceware, entropy, password strength estimation. One of the security services that provides user data protection is the authentication service. Currently, each system uses some type of user authentication, most often – password based. However, without sufficient attention to user-generated passwords, such a system is quite vulnerable to hacker attacks. Users of the system often create easily crackable passwords, such as passw0rd, admin, etc. which can be guessed in a few seconds. Therefore, to improve the resilience of passwords to cracking, password generators are used based on random or pseudo-random number sequence generators, which can provide users with a complex password, that will be used in the system to verify the identity of the user. Therefore, to improve the resilience of passwords to cracking, password generators are used based on random or pseudo-random number sequence generators, which can provide users with a complex password, that will be used in the system to verify the identity of the user. To improve the complexity of the password and make it easier to remember at the same time, it is recommended to use the Diceware random password generation algorithm. The strength of a random password against a specific attack (brute force attack) can be calculated by calculating the information entropy of the random process that generated the password. If each character in the password is generated independently and with uniform probability, the entropy in bits is given by the following formula. where N is the number of possible characters and L is the number of characters in the password. For comparison, a mechanical 72-character password generation algorithm, an algorithm using AES-256 PBKDF2-SHA256, a standard Diceware implementation, and a own modification of the latest were selected. The mechanical generator is implemented using the ANSI X9.17 pseudo-random number generator and uses 72 characters, which include lowercase and uppercase English letters, numbers and some characters. Generation is performed by obtaining three pseudo-random numbers using a generator, which are used as indices in a three- dimensional array to access the desired character. The operation is repeated until the desired password length is reached. As an example of a commercial product for generating passwords, an algorithm that uses AES-256 PBKDF2-SHA256 was chosen, which was provided by the software application LastPass [1]. Diceware is a method of creating password phrases, passwords and other cryptographic variables, using ordinary dice as a hardware generator of random numbers [2]. Each word in the passphrase requires five dice rolls. The resulting numbers 1 to 6 are added as a five-digit number, such as 43146. This number is then used to search for a word in the word list. By generating several words sequentially, you can build a long, easy-to-remember, and easy-to-choose password. Modification of this algorithm involves generating a password not only by choosing words, but also by randomly changing a capital letter in each word and replacing the letters with some numbers, such as the letter ""o"" by 0. The initial stage of the modified Diceware algorithm consists of reading a set of words from a file, by default - an English dictionary. The next step is word generation. First, a number from 0 to 7775 is generated, a word is selected from a set of words, the index of which corresponds to the generated number. A number from 0 to 1 is then generated, which determines whether the word will have a capital letter or not. The next step is to search for the remaining characters. If the symbol is ""o"", ""i"" or ""l"", then a number will be generated between 0 and 1, which determines whether the symbol will be replaced by ""0"", ""1"" or ""7"" respectively, or not. The process is repeated until the desired password length is reached. In this case, the length of the password is determined not by the number of characters, but by the number of words generated in the resulted password. The final step is to combine the resulting words into a single one, with the words separated by a hyphen. In Ukraine, there is no legal framework that would regulate the requirements for the passwords used, because of this as the indicator of a good password the requirements of the standard NIST.SP.800-63b [3], which regulates the properties that a certified password must have, will be used. There is the section in this document designed for passwords that are to be remembered. The following requirements are put towards them: length from 8 to 64 characters; all ASCII and UNICODE characters must be present; for generated passwords approved random bit generators specified in the regulatory document NIST.SP.800-90Ar1 [4] must be used; passwords should not be previously compromised, in the database of light passwords, depend on the context and have repetitive characters, as well as use words from the dictionary. Determining password complexity in a software application is determined by entropy and character entropy. Formulas 1 and 2, respectively, are used to calculate them. where H is the total entropy, L is the number of characters in the password. The results of the analysis of entropy and entropy per symbol for passwords generated by each algorithm are given in table. 1. The results show that using the modified Diceware algorithm, the entropy per symbol is 1.4 bits higher than the standard algorithm.

70,Сompetitiveness factors prognosis of international educational programs of Chinese Educational Establishments,24,Chen J.," Systematic dynamic modeling and simulation of the Chinese supply network The financial supply chain is a financing regime that attracts support from the strength of key enterprises and is based on a relationship with the supply chain and collateral to provide financial support to SMEs. The use of supply chain finance can achieve a win-win situation for SMEs, core businesses and financial institutions. Thus, supply chain funding that increases social welfare has been supported by China's national policy. In February 2016, the Chinese government published an analytical article on financial support for stable growth, structural adjustments and industry efficiency. It is noteworthy that the supply chain finance as a new model of financing - changed the original model of bank lending. The financial supply chain has adopted a new ""core loan / debt loan"" model for conducting credit inspections of SMEs, relaying to future cash flow generated by transactions and core corporate loans. This can help increase the availability of credit to SMEs, while providing a new method of bank risk management [1]. Thus, the essence of supply chain financing is credit financing, and credit risk control remains a key aspect of financial risk management. The credit risk of supply chain financing has a broad approach. Most researchers have focused on credit risk prevention and credit rating models that model the supply chain. A new integrated approach [2] of machine learning for forecasting the credit risk of SMEs in supply finance is proposed. [3, 4] LR model, ENN model and three types of two-stage Hybrid model for forecasting credit risk of SMEs for financial institutions in the field of supply finance. A credit model for SME assessment based on the principle of variable weight with its dynamic data has been created [7, 8] in order to increase the accuracy of credit risk assessment. In the supply chain, the supply chain of financial credit risk is studied from different angles. It has been studied [5] that when building multilevel connections of SMEs in the supply network, the availability of equity and debt capital can increase through the exchange of information; A new view [6] is proposed, when studying the trade credit preferences of suppliers through a horizontal channel. From the existing literature, research on the financial credit risk supply network is mainly focused on credit rating and SME risk aversion. However, the financial supply chain is a complex system that includes many enterprises, financial institutions and so on. There are several studies on the factors influencing credit risk and the feedback mechanism of a complex system. The biggest difference between supply chain finance and traditional trade and credit finance is that the supply chain needs to find large core businesses for operations [7] and then move to SMEs to increase lending through trade and guarantee relationships with major businesses. . Thus, the level of cooperation between major enterprises and SMEs has a major impact on the financial risk of the supply chain. Using the theory of system dynamics and Vensim software simulation, the team studied the factors of influence and feedback mechanism, which is a financial credit risk in terms of the supply system of the supply chain [8]. Presentation of the main research results Experiments of learning scenarios on simulation models of the AnyLogic system were conducted to determine the mutual influence of the competitiveness factors of the university [9]. The experiment was implemented to compare the competitiveness of specialized programs of two Chinese higher education institutions: Weihai Vocational College and Shanghai University of Transportation. The initial state of the modeled system is determined by the values of parameters that determine market share and the number of potential students of the above institutions of higher education. The analysis was carried out with a relatively equal total number of potential students in the region - market segment, 1000 people per year. For the initial data ""teacher rating"", ""student performance"", ""university rating"", ""teacher qualification"", ""tuition price"", the data that are in the public domain were taken. To analyze the scenario, the input variables define parameters that set their target (required) values. In our case, they include: ""cost"" of education, ""number"" of the group, rating ""university"", ""qualification"" of teachers, ""students"" educational performance, ""assessment"". By changing these parameters in a simple experiment mode, you can analyze the consequences of possible design decisions. The result of the experiment of competitiveness of Weihai Vocational College with the initial conditions: 312 potential students per program (Fig. 1). Figure1 – The result of an experiment to determine the competitiveness of Weihai Vocational College with the initial conditions As the results show, with a significant level of teacher qualifications and university rankings, the increased tuition fee does not significantly affect the number of potential students. However, in the case of Weihai Vocational College, when the price of tuition increases to the level of universities with a higher rating and quality of educational services, the number of potential students is reduced by almost half. The results allow us to conclude that in order to attract more funds by raising fees for educational services, we must first invest in improving the skills of their teachers, attract experts with an international name, work comprehensively to improve the rating of educational institutions.

71,Comparison of Methods of Development of Computer Video Games in Project Management in the Game Industry,27,"Chernetsky N., Pavlichenko A., Morozov V."," The video game market has emerged relatively recently and has gradually expanded with the development of computing power. Gradually, technologies improved and products could better express the ideas and wishes of their authors, but at the same time it made them more difficult to develop, especially in small teams. Therefore, small groups of like-minded people were forced to grow into large companies, which set the vector for the development of the industry. Naturally, there were other companies that did not have the necessary resources or were relatively young, so today there is a situation where the gaming industry market is divided into small indie-studios and large companies. The difference in the amount of work and resources used by these two abstract groups creates differences in the development processes, including the management of such projects. Games have different phases and styles of development depending on the scale of goal. The game projects in such a large company as Ubisoft always have Conception phase, Pre-production, Production phase, and Operation phase. The Conception phase is where the general plan for the project is made together with broad decisions like genre, world design, and basic story elements. In the Pre-production, the technical foundations are put in place, and the first playable parts are tested to ensure the project is on the right track in terms of engine and tools. In the Production phase, the teams are fully staffed, and the game is eventually finished. But before it’s finished, the game must pass two major milestones during this phase: Alpha and Beta. Alpha means that the game must be playable from start to finish to allow for proper testing. Beta means that everything should be done, which adds precious time for polishing and bug fixes before the game is launched. After the game is released, they move into an Operation phase to provide continuous support and produce additional content. During these phases, they work in so called Production Builds, which consist of two to three week long Sprints, with a planning phase at the start and review phase in the end. Production Builds allow them to keep track of the scope and makes sure there is time for reviews and iteration. Regarding game development in small indie studios that specialize in creating mobile games. They operate in completely different categories. The project in such organizations is developed not from two to four years as in development companies, but from three to six months. In such studios, project management does not operate in phases but in ""scopes of tasks"". As for the organizational structure of a large computer game development company, its scale cannot be ignored. For example, we will take the organizational structure of Massive Entertainment, during the development of Tom Clansy's The Division 2. The top of the structure is occupied by the producer, the Creative Director reports to him, who, in turn, six other directors: Art Director, Game Director, Narrative Director, Online Director, Audio Director, Realization Director. Also Producer has many Associate Producers who work directly with Project Coordinators, they are in contact with Leads of different departments. Leads are usually senior developers who are responsible for the results of their department and to whom a group of specialists reports. Massive Entertainment has the following departments: Level Art, Concept Art, Tech Art, Animation, Game Design, Gameplay Code, UI Design, Audio Design, Backend Code, Quality Control, Localization, Build Infra, Live Services, Analytics, Level Design, Character Art, Tech LD, Tech Animation, Narrative Design, AI Code, UI Code, Audio Code, Online Infra, VFX Art, Prop Art, UI Art, Music. And there are also support departments: Outsourcing, Engine, Brand, Consumer Experience, Community Managers, User Research. There is a common practice that the PM has a background of a technical specialist with sufficient experience, which gives him broad knowledge in the subject area and the ability to autonomously analyze the project in the initial stages. The formation of PM in the development of game products differs significantly: even in the development of a small game there are many different technical areas, which complicates the understanding of the subject area and encourages close work with the team/ ",video game market emerg rel recent gradual expand develop comput power gradual technolog improv product could better express idea wish author time made difficult develop especi small team therefor small group like mind peopl forc grow larg compani set vector develop industri natur compani necessari resourc rel young today situat game industri market divid small indi studio larg compani differ amount work resourc use two group creat differ develop process includ manag project game differ phase style develop depend scale goal game project larg compani ubisoft alway concept phase pre product product phase oper phase concept phase gener plan project made togeth broad decis like genr world design basic stori element pre product technic foundat put place first playabl part test ensur project right track term engin tool product phase team fulli staf game eventu finish finish game must pass two major mileston phase alpha beta alpha mean game must playabl start finish allow proper test beta mean everyth done add preciou time polish bug fix game launch game releas move oper phase provid continu support produc addit content phase work call product build consist two three week long sprint plan phase start review phase end product build allow keep track scope make sure time review iter regard game develop small indi studio special creat mobil game oper complet differ categori project organ develop two four year develop compani three six month studio project manag oper phase scope task organiz structur larg comput game develop compani scale ignor exampl take organiz structur massiv entertain develop tom clansi divis top structur occupi produc creativ director report turn six director art director game director narr director onlin director audio director realiz director also produc mani associ produc work directli project coordin contact lead differ depart lead usual senior develop respons result depart group specialist report massiv entertain follow depart level art concept art tech art anim game design gameplay code ui design audio design backend code qualiti control local build infra live servic analyt level design charact art tech ld tech anim narr design ai code ui code audio code onlin infra vfx art prop art ui art music also support depart outsourc engin brand consum experi commun manag user research common practic pm background technic specialist suffici experi give broad knowledg subject area abil autonom analyz project initi stage format pm develop game product differ significantli even develop small game mani differ technic area complic understand subject area encourag close work team,72
72,Analysis of Forecasting Methods for Financial Markets,29,"Deinega V., Mochalova D."," Abstract. This article describes different methods for predicting financial markets. The regression analysis, its properties, Gauss-Markov conditions, conditions of its application are described. Also described is exponential smoothing, variations of this method with its characteristics. The article describes the method based on the adaptive network based on the fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Based on the results of the study, an analytics of these methods was made with their pros and cons, and as a result, the conclusions were made. Keywords: forecasting, regression analysis, financial markets, method, exponential smoothing, ANFIS, hybrid system, time series. In recent decades, financial markets have experienced a period of rapid development. Along with large national stock, futures, and foreign exchange markets, global markets have emerged. Many money market transactions are based on the forecasting of short-term stock price movements by market participants. Effective market analysis requires up-to-date methods. Thus, research in the field of predicting the behavior of stock markets is a relevant and promising area of activity and will remain so for a fairly long period of time. Forecasting is a complex process, during which it is necessary to solve a large number of different issues. There are many methods for forecasting financial markets. In particular, regression analysis, decision trees, nearest neighbor method, neural networks, etc. Next, we will describe several methods for forecasting, and their features. It is worth noting that each of them is worthy of a separate study, and the study of options for its use. One of the main questions when building a forecast is always in the amount of available data. For what period are they, are they relevant, is it necessary to consider the entire available time series, etc. Often for analysts, a dilemma arises that if you take a lot of data, then the relevance will be lost, due to older data (especially in very sensitive sciences to the novelty of data). If we take the most recent data, then the data may not be enough. Each situation must find its own way of solving. But it is worth taking into account the peculiarities of each method. For example, the regression analysis method we are considering is well suited for analyzing short time series. That is, where there is not enough data in other methods, then regression analysis may work better in this situation. Regression analysis is a method of modeling measured data and studying their properties. Data consists of pairs of values for the dependent variable (response variable) and the independent variable (explanatory variable). The regression model is a function of the independent variable and parameters with an added random variable. The parameters of the model are adjusted so that the model best fits the data. The criterion for the quality of the approximation (objective function) is usually the root- mean-square error: the sum of the squares of the difference between the values of the model and the dependent variable for all values of the independent variable as an argument. To confirm or disprove this hypothesis, statistical tests called residual analysis are performed. It is worth noting that to study the quality of the model, additional tests of hypotheses, the coefficient of determination, etc., are used. To obtain the best estimates, it is necessary to fulfill the assumptions of the OLS (Gauss-Markov conditions). A paired regression model is considered, in which observations Y are related to X by the following relationship: Yi=b1+b2*Xi+ei. On the basis of n sample observations, the regression equation is estimated Y'i=b'1+b’2*Xi The Gauss-Markov theorem states: If the data has the following properties: The data model is correctly specified; All Xi are deterministic and not all are equal; Errors are not systematic, that is, E(ei)=0 ∀i; The variance of errors is the same and equal to σ2; Errors are not correlated, that is, Cov(ei,ej)=0∀i,j; - then under these conditions the least squares estimates are optimal in the class of linear unbiased estimates. What should be said that if the autocorrelation of errors is violated, checking through the Durbin - Watson test, for example, then we should pay attention to another, autoregressive, model, such as the modern ARIMA method. Building a high-quality regression model of activity. In the article [1] it is said that for successful execution it is necessary to use a lot of knowledge from different areas, which complicates the construction of the model. The emphasis of the work is made on the application of the process approach, from which the elimination of planning deficiencies comes out, etc. The problem with this method is that it is not flexible. In the studied tasks, the trend, like seasonality, can change, and not be static as required by the regression analysis. In a time series where the above characteristics change more, another method is suitable. For example, in the further detailed analysis of the method as exponential smoothing, there is no such problem. Moreover, this method shows good efficiency. But there is a drawback in that it cannot predict well over longer time frames. Exponential smoothing is a mathematical transformation technique that is used in time series forecasting. It got its name because at each subsequent iteration, all previous values of the series are taken into account, but the degree of accounting decreases exponentially. Table 1 – Three types of exponential smoothing Exponential smoothing is a relatively simple but effective forecasting method. The article [2] tells about a relatively simple but powerful and versatile method for forecasting time series data, about a simple method of exponential smoothing. From the article, you can come to an understanding of the operation of the method itself and its shortcomings, that the emphasis is on the latest observations (of course, it all depends on the coefficients) and with an increase in the smoothing constant to get a faster answer, it can lead to an increased sensitivity of the model to random fluctuations. Also, the article [3] describes different variations of using exponential smoothing to predict stock prices. Three types of the considered method are analyzed: single exponential smoothing, double exponential smoothing, and triple exponential smoothing. The article shows the efficiency of the method for forecasting prices, but it also expounds the idea from the conclusions that using only the last method, the most extensive, does not always lead to the best results, a simplified method can provide better characteristics based on various factors. Combining forecasts from several different models is an effective technique. Combining multiple predictions can significantly reduce overall prediction errors by improving predictions. Neural networks are also often used in forecasting. There are a large number of variations, but below we will briefly talk about the adaptive network based on the fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Hybrid neuro-fuzzy systems have found a much wider field of application than all other methods of synthesis of fuzzy sets and neural networks. This is due to the fact that they allow the fullest use of the strengths of fuzzy systems and neural networks. A characteristic feature of hybrid systems is that they can always be considered as systems of fuzzy rules, while the adjustment of membership functions in the premises and inferences of rules based on the training set is performed using the neural network. There are several hybrid system architectures, each of which is designed to solve its own set of problems. The article [4] describes the use of neural networks in financial markets. The article argues that the use of neural networks allows you to ensure profit in the financial markets. With the pros and cons. Also in the article [5] it is stated that while forecasting the stock market is a very difficult action, because there are too many factors that can influence, the ANFIS method is an effective tool for forecasting, and the forecasting performance shows the advantages of this method. According to the results of the study, a number of forecasting methods were considered. The results of the analysis are formed in table 2. Table 2 – Analytics of research methods for forecasting currency pairs Based on the analysis of forecasting methods, it has been established that for good forecasting, it is necessary to correctly approach the choice of the method. In one case, one is better, such as using regression analysis for short time series, in the other, universal exponential smoothing. In addition, it should be said that each method has its own ranking, several variants of the method for different situations in the same exponential smoothing, or the analysis of the fulfillment of the Gauss-Markov conditions of regression analysis, which falls on the analyst. The correct setting of methods is also important, for example, the correct selection of factors in the same hybrid systems. And of course, the important point is the correctness and validity of the original data available. An effective method is to combine the forecasts available to obtain the best result. 2012 ",articl describ differ method predict financi market regress analysi properti gauss markov condit condit

73,Random Forest Algorithm in Predicting Diabetes (Type 2),33,"Fedirko Yu., Yehorchenkov O."," Abstract. The purpose of this paper is to present the relevance of predicting diabetes using machine learning technics, as well as to developed efficient deep learning model. During the research, we've trained model with random forest algorithm to determine patient status. We`ve used Iraqi dataset, having previously processed the data using outlier rejection, data normalization, and attributes selection. Due to research we`ve got a model for determining diabetes with high accuracy. We`ve determined that Iraqi dataset can be used in the following studies. Keywords: Random Forest, Diabetes Diabetes is a chronic disease that causes serious damage to the whole body without being identified in time. About 422 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. And the trend has been steadily growing in recent decades [1]. In our research we focus on predicting type 2 diabetes due to the fact that researchers don’t know exactly causes of type 1 diabetes. Type 2 is mixed from genetics and lifestyle factors. Since diabetes cannot be fully cured and it requires constant monitoring and adjustment of life, determining it at an early stage can help to adapt to new conditions. Also, a belated definition of diabetes leads to an increased risk of death from diabetes and related factors. Unfortunately, medical staff does not always look at the tests in the complex, and patients do not pass a number of tests annually. The availability of diabetes risk assessment tools for specific parameters is an open question today. Data science is close to solving this problem. Researchers are actively using data-driven machine learning techniques to determine patient status. Today, machine learning methods are used to predict the onset of diabetes. Popular predictive health algorithms include linear regression, decision tree, logistic regression, SVM, Naive Bayes classifier, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and more. Quite a lot of work in this area has been written using the data set available in the UCI Machine Learning repository [2] based in India, the PIMA data set. The accuracy of the proposed models reaches 80%. Also, this is a fairly old data set. Therefore, we decided to use the latest data provided by the laboratory of the Medical City Hospital [Помилка! Джерело посилання не знайдено.]. The data were collected from the Iraqi society of 1000 patients. The data consist of: Gender, AGE, Urea, Cr (creatinine ratio), HbA1c (glycohemoglobin), Chol (cholesterol), TG (triglycerides), HDL (high density lipoprotein), LDL (low density lipoprotein), VLDL (very low density lipoprotein),), BMI (body mass index), CLASS (the patient's diabetes disease class may be Diabetic, Non-Diabetic, or Predict- Diabetic). Diabetes causes are not studied well. Exactly reason for diabetes is uncertain, but there are factors that can take role in this health issue. It is generally connected with genetic factors, obesity, blood pressure, cholesterol and more. Detecting of diabetes is crucial in fight with stroke [4]. As we can observe most of the factors in this dataset are present and we can expect their efficiency. Table 1 shows statistical summary for all instances in the data set. Table 1 Dataset summary In the dataset there are eleven possible factors of causing diabetes. All instances are presented in 1000 values. Figure 1. Histogram of diabetes status Data are distributed in ratio: 844 people have diabetes status, 103 don’t have and 53 have pre-diabetic status. Study process includes pre-processing the dataset, splitting into train and test sets, applying ML algorithm, evaluating model. In this study to provide prediction we use random forest technic as it proved its efficiency in health industry [5]. Implementation of the process have been conducted using machine learning library Sklearn, figure and graph have been done using Seaborn library. The preprocessing includes: outlier rejection, filling missing values, data normalization, and attributes selection to improve the quality of data [6]. After outlier rejection using Scipy library, the dataset volume became 888 instances. Dataset has not missing values. We use Spearman’s correlation method to find the most relevant attributes. We used 0.1 as a cut-off for relevant attributes. LDL, HDL, Cr are removed. Table 2 The correlation between attributes and diabetic status Machine learning algorithms tend to perform better or converge faster when the different variables are on a smaller scale [7]. To normalize the data we used MinMaxScaler from Sklearn library. The dataset was divided on a ratio of 70:30 for creating training and test split. Figure 2. Confusion matrix resulted from test set evaluation Table 3 Classification report for precision, recall f1-score and accuracy Accuracy of model is 0,98. Precision is bad only in determination non-diabetics person, this fact provides a valid proof that diabetes of patients from Iraqi can be detected using Machine Learning techniques, mainly with random forest. Conclusions. Early detection of diabetes is one of the main challenges in the health care industry. In our research, we used random forest method, which showed high accuracy. We preprocessed the data using the slicing outliners, normalization and correlation to find most significant values. We used eight input instances and one output (CLASS) in the dataset.

74,Collecting Feedback During Online Conferences as a Means of Increasing Team Productivity,37,"Fediuk D., Khlevna Iu."," Abstract. The paper describes a way to improve the effectiveness of online conferences by collecting feedback from meeting participants online and then using it to improve team performance. Keywords: Online conferences, Zoom, Development of team members. An important role in the successful implementation of the project is the communication of people with each other. Unfortunately, due to current events related to the coronavirus pandemic, effective human communication has become threatened, as it has become unsafe for people to meet in the same room. Fortunately, information technology and the widespread use of computers and mobile devices have helped partially solve this problem through the use of video communication programs. Since the beginning of the pandemic, everyone from high school students to professors have started using video conferencing in their daily work and studies. One of the most popular applications for online conferencing is Zoom. So, according to this company's investor reports [1] (Fig. 1), the number of business customers (companies with more than ten employees) at the end of 2020 was up 470.33% from the end of 2019. The company sold 385,200 new licenses. Fig. 1 – Zoom Business Customers It has now become obvious to all that such communication tools are essential in a remote work or study environment. However, communication through video conferencing software has its disadvantages. The big disadvantage of such a tool is the lack of feedback between conference participants. After all, effective communication is not only the delivery of certain information, but also getting feedback from colleagues about the speech and the work done with the subsequent application of the recommendations received. A speaker who cannot get feedback from the audience cannot improve his or her performance in the future because he or she will not even know what he or she needs to work on. This in turn leads to ineffective meetings and leads to the fact that most workers begin to think that holding online meetings is a waste of time [2]. This is a big problem for project managers because the continued success of a project depends heavily on communication. One solution to this problem could be the creation of the possibility of writing wishes, as well as evaluating the work of each of the participants directly in the meeting. Such system will help all the participants, without interrupting the speaker, to give their feedback at any moment of the meeting. And, thanks to anonymity, the employee will not feel uncomfortable when will leave feedback on the work of his boss or colleague, which promotes openness and honesty. Manager, who conducted the meeting, after it will be able to get detailed information about what employees think about the meeting as a whole, to get an assessment of the work done by each of its participants. Having analyzed this information, the manager will have a basis for further improvements in working with the team, decision making, optimization of communication processes in the company. Such an assessment of the meeting participants over a long period of time will help to objectively assess the strengths and weaknesses of each team member, thus becoming a reference point for their further development. According to Peter Drucker quote, ""you can't manage what you can't measure"". Speaking about the possibility of implementing this system. In the previously mentioned Zoom, program for online conferences, there is Zoom Marketplace [3], where third-party developers can create their own applications, add-ons for the main program, and users can install and use them during the conference. That way, companies that don't have their own IT department to develop such an app for their company's needs can use a third-party solution. This can be a good start to implementing such a system and obtaining its benefits both for companies and educational institutions.

75,Use of Ontologies and Graphs of Knowledge in the Educational Process,39,Gaina G.," Abstract. The work is devoted to modeling of educational systems with the use of ontologies and graphs of knowledge. Educational and research institutions work with large amounts of open data, which in many cases are not systematized and organized, the content of many concepts is not clear, the relationship between different concepts of the subject area is not defined. Ontologies allow you to display a semantic representation of data, and knowledge graphs allow you to use the Internet as a channel to access related data from a variety of sources. Keywords: ontology, graph of knowledge, computer science, artificial intelligence Introduction One of the basic directions of introduction of information technologies in educational activity is development and introduction of semantic methods which are based on use of ontologies in certain subject areas and models of Linked Open Data (LOD). Ontologies and knowledge graphs provide effective tools for building information systems. An example of an educational platform based on LOD technologies is the LinkedUp (Linking Web data for education), ECOLE (Enhanced Course Ontology for Linked Education) projects [1]. Open Educational Resources (OER) is digital content for educational purposes, available through websites that can be freely reused by teachers and students [2]. Ontologies and graphs of knowledge in the educational process The main directions of research conducted in the field of LOD use in education are related to the modeling of the educational process, educational specialties and educational materials, as well as the content of the subject area, its basic concepts and connections between them [3]. The specialty ""Computer Science"" and the educational program ""Artificial Intelligence Technologies"" are considered in the work as a subject area. The ontological approach allows to form a complete and well-structured information base for solving the subject area. An ontology describes the types of entities that exist and form classes, the relationships between them that reflect properties, and the axioms that reflect logical dependencies. Any ontology involves the selection of its three interrelated components: a taxonomy of terms, descriptions of the meaning of terms, and rules for their use and processing. Ontology is used to structure information. RDFS and OWL languages have been developed to describe ontologies that are available through the Web. Graphs of knowledge allow to solve intellectual problems, problems that are difficult to formalize, first of all performing the functions of data binding, data semantization. The main purpose of using LOD is to use the Internet architecture to exchange, disseminate and interconnect data from different sources into a common information space. Knowledge graphs allow you to move from disordered information to organized data, which is better to analyze, process, execute queries. Knowledge graphs allow you to return more complex results, semantically significant results, from a search query. Using RDF and RDFS allows you to identify objects and make them available, like web pages, through web addresses (URI). Ontology and graph of specialty knowledge The approach to creating an ontology and knowledge graph in the specialty ""Computer Science"" and the educational program ""Artificial Intelligence Technology"", which is proposed in the work allows you to structure knowledge, determine the competencies provided by the specialty and educational program, includes a subject thesaurus, and includes the possibility of constant expansion of the content by adding a graph of knowledge. In order to interpret the knowledge of the subject area, an analysis of the curriculum, which regulates the field of computer science. It is assumed to maintain logical consistency between ontologies. The composition of the system is proposed to build on two levels: Ontology of professional competencies. This ontology should be based on information from educational standards, educational programs. Includes terminology, reflects the structure of the knowledge graph of the subject area. Graph of knowledge of the subject area. The knowledge graph should reflect the areas of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Technology. It is possible to constantly expand the knowledge graph with new terms and connections. When all the necessary relations are established between all the terms of ontologies, different sources are combined by a graph of knowledge, then a single information space of the subject area is created.

76,Development of Methods for Environmental Pollution Monitoring,41,He Yu.," Abstract. Multifactor analysis of the formation of the level of pollution in combination with the operational forecast of the level of pollution is an effective way to help partially solve the problems of environmental pollution.. The importance of the technical component in ensuring monitoring is shown. By the task of monitoring the state of the environment, the structure of the information system for monitoring the state of the environment is proposed. Keywords: Environmental pollution, monitoring, sensor, information system The relevance of research on monitoring the state of environmental pollution is confirmed by the fact that the governments of all leading countries spend, on average, from 1% to 3% of their budgets on environmental protection measures. The automated information system of ecological monitoring is a system with the distributed organization of collecting, processing, documentation, and analyzing the parameters of the environment. It is an essential element and is designed to collect, process, operational and long-term storage of information, forecasting the state of the environment based on specific methods. The function of the system is to provide information to local information centers, management of enterprises and their departments for environmental protection, etc. The automated information system of ecological monitoring provides the performance of the following functions: automatic measurement of air, water, and soil parameters; information collection and primary information processing; control of deviation of current values of parameters from their control levels; visualization of information and formation of the operational state of affairs about specific parameters; forecasting changes in the state of pollution by various environmental indicators; transfer of information to interested parties, other information systems, and documentation of information. To ensure effective environmental monitoring, an important issue is a technical component of obtaining data on the state of the environment. The article [1] classifies known monitoring networks based on server characteristics into three classes: Static Sensor Network (SSN), Community Sensor Network (CSN), and Vehicle Sensor Network (VSN). Comprehensive reviews and comparisons of these three types of sensor networks were also conducted. Their significant limitations are revealed. Also popular are services that analyze air quality and visualize it on maps. For example, Fig. 1 shows a visualization of the level of air pollution over China and some other East Asian countries based on the results of the analysis of the AirVisual service [2]. Figure 1 – Visualization of the level of air pollution over China and some other East Asian countries. Proposals for solving the problem of monitoring pollution are given in [3]. One of the essential components of effective monitoring is the conclusion about the state of pollution and its consequences in the future. To do this, a useful tool can be forecasting the state of environmental pollution based on unique methods. Articles [4] describe some of these methods. In works [5], information technologies of forecasting with the use of neural networks, fuzzy expert systems, etc. are described. Consider the problem of assessing environmental pollution in two productions. Suppose you need to assess environmental pollution at a certain point. Environmental pollution can be assessed by a set of its indicators [1]. Let is a vector of real numbers that describes the state of the environment, where n is the number of indicators. Each coordinate of the vector corresponds to a specific indicator (concentration of sulfur dioxide in the air, concentration of nitrates in water, etc.). You can get the appropriate indicators both with the help of appropriate technical means (weather stations, mobile and stationary sensors, etc.) and with the help of specific services. The state of the environment is not a stationary quantity and changes over time. Therefore, indicators of the state of the environment should be considered as time- dependent functions. That is where t is the time. We believe that the indicators are updated at discrete moments (hourly, daily, monthly). That is 𝑡𝑖 = 𝑡0 + 𝑖𝛥𝑡, where 𝑡0 is the starting point of time,𝛥𝑡 is the frequency of observation, a 𝑖 = 1, 𝑚, where m – this is the number of observations. Let us mark 𝑟𝑗𝑗 (𝑡𝑖) by 𝑟𝑖. Then Solving the problem of environmental pollution assessment consists of the following stages: Collection of data on the state of environmental pollution in the past. Monitoring the current state of the environment. Forecasting the state of environmental pollution in the future. To find a solution to the first problem, it is necessary to build a database with a history of the state of environmental pollution. It can store both a one-dimensional and multidimensional version of the time series (for several indicators that are evaluated). The task of assessing environmental pollution in the setting on the plane is in common with the point set. Similarly, the task consists of three stages: collection, observation, and forecasting. The key difference in this statement is the need for an observation network. Then the information about the state of the environment can be described as a set of tuples   where 𝑅𝑖 is a vector that reflects the state of pollution indicators at a time 𝑡𝑖, 𝑖 = 1, 𝑚, а 𝐶𝑘 is information about data locations 𝑘 = 1, 𝑙.

77,Mathematical Model for Determination of Prioritizing Services When Allocating Limited Resources,44,"Hnatiienko H., Izhevska Ye."," Abstract. In this process, the problem of fair determination of the cost of living of different categories of students in dormitories for a certain deficit of this resource is considered. Quotas for settlements are introduced for certain categories and an algorithm for determining those who have the primary right to housing is provided. Additional criteria for organizing student sets by category are rating lists based on the performance of students of different courses. Keywords. Limited resources, priority, quotas, equitable distribution, heuristic. Introduction. The problem of equitable prioritization of tasks, the consistency of performing functions, ranking alternatives, ordering the importance of objects is a classic problem of many sectors of the national economy [1]. In addition, this problem is classical for the theory of decision-making, which is a comprehensively studied and at the same time an urgent problem for many situations of decision-making. Resource constraints are a fundamental challenge facing humankind. The issue in question can be formalized in the class of problems of allocation of limited resources, which is a key problem for large and small teams. The procedure for settling students in university dormitories in the context of a shortage of the university's housing stock is of great social importance, therefore there is a high probability of receiving negative feedback when incorrect, non-transparent and unfair results. Therefore, risks and possible misunderstandings in the allocation of resources should be minimized. The algorithm and procedure for allocating resources should be unambiguous, well-documented and not allow for different interpretations. It is necessary to exclude corruption risks in advance, and hence the subjective component at the decision-making stage. The latter should be clearly regulated and stipulated. Formulation of the problem. Let some organizational system, the structure of which is known, needs limited resources allocated at a higher level of management. Resource consumers are interconnected and different approaches to modeling and solving the problem can be proposed. This organizational system consists of several subsystems with different status and, accordingly, different rights to the share of resources allocated to partially meet the needs of the organization. Will model the problem in terms of allocating limited resources. Such problems are well studied, but they have a range of uses and in every practical situation cannot be easily and without changes be adapted to practical goals. Note that the values of the indicators characterizing the organizational system are unknown and dynamically change within some acceptable limits. In such cases, heuristics can be applied to make a decision. Model of faculty. A quota mechanism can be proposed: a fair determination of quotas and determination of the satisfaction of those in need of using the resource. Each situation is individual, but general approaches can be applied that allow to digitize the state and need for a settlement and will give an overall view and advice on making a decision, changing quotas, redistributing between faculties, etc. To model the problem of allocating limited resources, a mathematical model of the faculty should be built. To describe the structure of the faculty and the quantitative characteristics of the problem, we use the following notation: Q0 – a plural of faculty students eligible for priority housing needs; Qi , i  1,...,6, housing; – a set of nonresident students of relevant courses in need of 6 Q  ∪Qi i 1 – a set of faculty students applying for housing, Q0  Q ; k  a number of categories into which everyone who wants to get a place in the dormitories should be divided in order to distribute limited resources as fairly as possible to students; q  q1,..., qk  – a plural of quotas set for different categories of students; 2021  the possibilities of the university for the settlement of students of the faculty in the current year. Solution Algorithm. The settlement of nonresident students in dormitories is carried out according to the following criteria: f1  priority provision of beds for nonresident students of preferential categories of all courses of educational level (EL) “Bachelor” and EL “Master” - from set Q0 ; f 2  establishing a quota for such categories of students: Q0 – preferential categories of EL “Bachelor” and EL “Master”, Q1 – first course EL ""Bachelor""; f3  distribution of empty beds for the settlement of students from set Q1 – the first course of EL “Bachelor” according to the entrance rating score; f 4  establishment of a quota for categories of students: from the set of Q2 and Q3 courses EL “Bachelor” and EL “Master”; f5  distribution of empty beds for the settlement of 2nd and 3rd year students of OR ""Bachelor"" by academic score for the last year of study from the combined rating list Q2  Q3 . In this way, priorities have been introduced in relation to the settlement, which can formally be written in this form: Q0  Q1  Q2  Q3 > Q4  Q5  Q6. Note that the above criteria must be made public in advance, information about available places, applicants and rating lists is available, and the procedure used for distribution is transparent. To justify the decision on the equitable location of beds and to simplify the allocation procedure, we will introduce additional heuristics. Heuristic E1. Living conditions in all dormitories provided by universities are relatively the same. Heuristic E2. The students' declared wishes for the need to settle in a dormitory reflect the real need of nonresident students for a resource for living. Equity model. To model the concept of fairness as applied to this particular task, the following factors should be taken into account in the determination of quantitative indicators: the ratio of the number of applicants and places in dormitories; the cost of paying for an apartment in the city and the cost of paying for a dormitory; functions that reflect student success in learning; introduce heuristics about the fairness of the settlement of different categories of students; functions of the influence of the introduced quotas on the level of fairness; indicator of the integral satisfaction of students with the results of the settlement. Prospects for further research. To improve the described approaches to modeling the problem of allocating limited resources, further research requires: – approaches to rating students from sets Q 2 , Q3 with the aim of equitably combining these groups into one Q2  Q3 ; determination of the quality and validity of rating, taking into account the types of measurement scales; in-depth study of statistics and dynamics of changes in the structural units of the organizational system; modeling and substantiating the concept of fairness of satisfaction with a resource of various departments and the organizational system as a whole; reaching a compromise; investigation of the complexity of resource allocation algorithms; building a mathematical model for the distribution of a heterogeneous resource.

78,Mathematical Modeling of Functional Stability of Organizational System,47,"Hnatiienko H., Hnatiienko V., Rimek A."," Abstract. Considering the problem of ensuring the functional stability of the organizational system. Presenting the mathematical model of nominal resource needs and the main parameters that contribute to the study of sustainability. The concept of substituting the functions of some elements of the system in the event of an emergency situation is also introduced. Keywords: functional stability, nominal resource requirements, replacement of functions, staffing situation. Introduction. With the development of society and technology, attention is paid to the reliability, security and stability of complex organizational systems. At the same time, the system must ensure the sustainable operation of the facility, timely, reliable and comprehensive prevention of security threats, the functional stability of all departments and the system as a whole. For critical systems, the cost of verification and certification is extremely high and can reach half the total cost of the system. The objects of corporate security of the organization are management technologies, personnel of the organization, financial resources, material values, production technologies, business processes, information resources, etc. One of the essential features of organizational systems is the a priori existence of subjectivism - both in the construction of such systems and at all stages of their operation. One of the essential indicators of the level of safe operation of the system is functional stability. Functional stability is the ability of a system to perform its functions during a given time interval under the influence of the flow of operational failures, intentional damage, interference in the exchange and processing of information, as well as in case of errors of service personnel. Formulation of the problem. Suppose you set a set of indexes of functions that the system should provide. We will assume that such functions n . Denote the set of all functions performed by the system through A  a1,...an, J  1,..., n. Functions performed by different elements of the system are not duplicated, that is n  ni - iJ each function in the system is unique: Ai1  Ai2  ,i1 ,i2  J , where   empty set. This means that the optimization of business processes in the organizational system. It should be noted that the modeling of functional stability has been considered in many works, in particular, in [1-5]. Mathematical model of nominal resource needs in a staffing situation. We can build a matrix of functions performed by elements of the system: F i  ( f 0 , f 1 ) , where i i f 0   f 0 , j  1,..., n ,i  I  vector of basic functions i  element of system, i ij i f 1  f 1,c , s  j 1,..., n , s  1,...,ν ,i  I  matrix of related functions i  i is is i i element of system, cis , s  j  1,..., ni , s  1,...,ν i ,i  I  level of performance quality s  related function i  element of system. Let's denote by system. Ai ,i  J , a subset of the functions performed i  element of Each task ensures the quality and safe operation of the information system from a variety of tasks A  a1,...an characterized by two parameters: c0  nominal cost of execution or resource requirements, i  I ; t 0  nominal execution time, i  I . Each element of the system in normal mode performs the tasks assigned to it and has limited ability to perform the entire subset of its tasks: c j  C j , j  J , aij A j t j  T , for j, j  J . aij  A j Note that restrictions may be imposed on some tasks t j  T j , j  J , aij A j when for each element of the system or group of elements, resource limits are set for the time of the task. As we approach these limits, the quality of information security of any element of the system decreases significantly and there are threats to the information security of the entire system. Nominal tactical and technical characteristics of the system of functional stability is characterized by the need for a variety of resources, the most important of which in many organizations are: n c0i  C 0 - system operating budget, i1 n 0i 0 i – the total need for time to perform system functions. i1 Model of substitution of functions performed by some element of the system in a normal situation. Substitution of functions between elements of the system can be done according to the matrix of relationships only between those elements that can perform these tasks, according to their qualifications, available certificates, etc. In this case, the following heuristics should be considered. Assume, that the i  system element is missing and the subset problem Ai , i  J , executes an element with an index j, j  J , or multiple items ( ki , ki  k, ) with indexes jt  J \{i}, t  1,..., ki . In this case, according to accepted heuristics, the quality of subset tasks Ai , i  J , may be about 80% of nominal. And due to the additional load on items with indexes jt  J \{i}, t  1,..., ki , the quality of subset tasks A jt , j  J , t  J \ i, i  J , will also decrease significantly. Directions of development of modeling of functional stability of organizational system. Some additional tools can be used to improve the described approaches to modeling the task of ensuring the functional stability of the organizational system. In particular, the following should be considered: model for determining the level of critical elements of the organizational system. generating options for replacing the functions of missing elements; assessing the quality of replacement options and the impact of replacement functions on the quality of functioning of the elements; determining the integrated quality of the system as a whole; assessment of system resourcefulness based on identifying the number of sources of possible options for substituting functions; determining the impact of the multiplicity of replacements on the reliability of the system and the stability of operation.

79,Mathematical Support of the Rating Voting Procedure,50,"Hnatiienko H., Vlasenko O."," Abstract. The problem of determining the resulting ordering of objects on the basis of incomplete rankings or multiple comparisons is considered. It is proposed to apply the algebraic approach to substantiate and formalize the problem. A short list of classical voting methods and a scheme for solving the problem are given. Keywords: rating voting, priority, algebraic approach, Cook's metrics. Introduction. Among the goals facing the researcher should be noted [1]: selection of the best object; selection of a disordered subset of the best objects; ranking (ordering) of the whole set of objects; finding the resulting (collective, group) ranking of objects according to individual rankings set by experts. Based on traditional approaches, it is possible to build a combined examination, which is easy to implement, but its analysis requires adequate and sound methods of calculating the results. Methods of processing expert information are divided into three main groups [1]: statistical methods; scaling methods; algebraic methods. The essence of algebraic methods is that on the set of admissible estimates the distance is set and the resulting estimate is defined as such, the distance of which to the estimates of experts on a certain selected criterion is minimal. Based on the algebraic approach, we will determine the coefficients of relative competence of experts. An important way of presenting expert information is the ranking of alternatives[1]. In many practical problems there is a need to use multiple comparisons or incomplete rankings. Incomplete rankings were studied, for example, in [2-4]. In the monograph[2], the classical methods of voting theory were used to determine the generalized ranking of alternatives. However, in such cases, the use of algebraic methods of calculating the median, which reflects the collective opinion of experts, is promising. Formulation of the problem. Let k the experts carry out a preliminary examination n of some projects, objects or applicants for the position. Under the terms of the examination, the members of the expert group at the first stage must specify incomplete rankings or multiple comparisons of ν objects, and ν  n . It is necessary to develop algorithms for calculating the resulting ranking of alternatives, consistent with the given incomplete rankings of experts, taking into account different metrics and different criteria [5]. In [4, 5] the concept of incomplete ranking was introduced: it is a binary relation given on a subset of alternatives A' , A' A , which satisfies the properties of completeness, antisymmetry, transitivity: but only on a subset whole set A . A' , A' A , and not on the The distances between the rankings of alternatives are determined using metrics [5]: – Cook's metrics of mismatch of ranks (places, positions) of alternatives, d R j , Rl   r j  rl , (1) i i iI where r l  rank i  alternatives in ranking l  expert, Rl , l  L, 1  rl  n, Heming's metrics; Euclid's metrics; preference vector, the elements of which are the number of alternatives that precede each alternative in the ranking. Criteria that are most often used in the following cases: additive; minimax. Formalization of the problem of determining the resulting ranking The most common method of finding the resulting ranking of alternatives is to calculate the median of the given rankings. This group of methods for generalizing expert information is the most reliable and mathematically sound. The solutions of the problem, which are determined by applying different metrics and different criteria, are the medians of the linear orders given by the experts. Cook's metric is popular in the ranking of alternatives [1, 3, 5]. To apply it in solving the problem of analysis of incomplete rankings, we introduce heuristics and determine on their basis the distances from the rankings set by experts to the reference ranking. Due to the peculiarities of the calculation of generalized ranking with incomplete initial information, in [3, 4] it is proposed to use a number of heuristics. In particular, the distance components for incomplete object rankings are described as follows. Heuristics E1. Distance from incomplete rankings set by experts RiН , i  1,..., k, to any ranking probabilistic. R*(0) consists of two components: a certain part of the distance and Heuristics E2. An alternative not specified by an expert creates an unknown relationship between all other alternatives and does not participate in the ranking, ie this alternative is not represented in the incomplete ranking. Thus, when setting incomplete rankings for each expert, we have a number of alternatives: ni  given by him alternatives in the ranking RiН ,i  1,..., k, which will be a certain part of the distances; (n  ni ) ν i  non-expert alternatives in ranking RiН , i  1,..., k, which make up the probabilistic part of the distances. Heuristics E3. Probabilistic part of the distance from the ranking set by the expert RiН , i  1,..., k, metrics. to any reference ranking is always equal to ν i ,i  1,..., k, for Cook's The determined part of the distances [6,7] is calculated by formula (1). Using classical methods to determine the solution Classical methods of choice theory (Condorcet, Bord, Simpson, Copeland, Nanson, Kemeni-Young, Taideman, Schulze, Baldwin, alternative voices, relative majority, etc.) can also be used to a limited extent in determining the resulting ranking [8]. The application of some rules in such a problem is described, for example, in the monograph [2]. The study of ways to apply the classical methods of choice theory to determine the weights should be carried out in the further development of the method described in this paper. Board rule. Each voter announces their preferences, ranking m candidates from best to worst (indifference is prohibited). The candidate does not receive points for the last place, receives one point from each candidate for the penultimate, receives m - 1 points for the first place. The candidate with the highest sum of points wins. Condorcet's rule. For a given voting results table (warning table), the Condors winner is the candidate who beats any other candidate by pairwise comparison by a majority rule. If paired comparisons form a cycle, then there is no winner for Condors, and they say that there is a so-called Condor paradox. Copeland's rule. Let's compare the candidate 𝑎 with any other candidate 𝑥. Assign it K (a ≻ x) = +1, if for the majority a ≻ x, K (a ≻ x) = −1, if for the majority x ≻ a and K (a ≻ x) = 0 with equality in the evaluation of candidates. Copeland's estimate for candidate 𝑎 is the sum of 𝐾 (𝑎) = ∑𝑥 𝐾 (𝑎 ≻ 𝑥). The candidate with the highest Copeland score is selected. Simpson's rule. Consider candidate 𝑎 and any other candidate 𝑥. Let S (a ≻ x) denote the number of voters for whom a ≻ x. Simpson's estimate for the candidate 𝑎 is called the minimum of the numbers S (a ≻ x): 𝑆 (𝑎) = ∑𝑥 𝑆 (𝑎 ≻ 𝑥). The candidate with the highest score of Simpson is selected. Scheme for solving the problem. Selection of task parameters. Provide anonymous voting, for example, using Google spreadsheets. votes. Determining the winners and eliminating such projects that did not receive any With a large dimension of the task of screening such projects that received the minimum number of votes. Graph connectivity analysis. Prompt researchers about additional voting or other heuristics to overcome dichotomy. Application of multi-round voting. Study of the number of options for different numbers of projects in multiple comparisons. Conclusions. The problem of ordering a subset of objects is considered. Based on this examination, an algebraic approach to the analysis of incomplete rankings is proposed. A comparison of classical methods of group selection with the algorithm for determining the median with incomplete initial information. The scheme of solving the problem in the given statement is described.

80,Development of GIS Using for Monitoring Crop Yields,54,Huang M.," Abstract. The development of geographic information systems is an important prerequisite for the effective implementation of information systems in agriculture. The paper describes the objects and subjects of the environment in which the geo- information system operates. A mathematical model for describing the problem of crop yield monitoring is also proposed. The model is based on the analysis of the crop image and the use of time series analysis. Keywords: IS, agriculture, multi-objective optimization In recent decades, the use of digital images of geographical areas for agricultural purposes has become relevant. The rapid development of this area is facilitated by the development of wireless technology, digital photography technology, image display devices, operating systems, and services for storing and processing these images. These opportunities have become a prerequisite for the intensive development of geographic information systems and technologies in general. Paper [1] describes the hypothesis that inhomogeneities can directly determine crop yields in field images. The processing of digital images of fields provides valuable information about the state of agricultural crops, allows you to assess plant health and predict the yield, timing, quantity, and quality of products in the future. The image of sown areas can be presented in the form of time series, which allows them to apply appropriate methods of their forecasting [2]. The works [3] describe the methods and technologies of processing time series of digital images for decision-making in agriculture. The main phenological indicator in the analysis of images of sown areas is the normalized differential vegetation index. This is a quantitative indicator of active photosynthetic biomass used to quantify vegetation, which is calculated by the formula: where R is the intensity of the light reflected from the surface of the spectrum in the visible red region (630-690 nm), N is the intensity of the light reflected from the surface of the spectrum in the infrared region of the spectrum (760-900 nm). The input data for the information system is the image of the site. The image can be represented as some size matrix. The image shows culture on certain pixels, others show a soil that is not culture. The intensities for each image have an intensity distribution close to the normal distribution (See fig.1). Figure 2 – a) The image of the fled with growing corps retrieved from Google maps b) Color histogram. Therefore, a threshold function can be introduced where x, y are the coordinates of the pixel in the image, β is the value of the NDVI in a particular pixel, and B is some threshold value. Then the yield of the site is described by the following model: where o the distribution density of the culture in the image, r the distribution density of the culture. Yield can be estimated by finding a two-dimensional integral of crop density. The model of forecasting based on phenological indicators is based on the definition of critical points in the NDVI trajectory. Sequential measurements of NDVI for one site at specified intervals (day, week, two weeks, etc.) form a discrete-time series of estimates Using prediction methods for time series [2], predict NDVI values for subsequent periods. And using the model of yield forecasting (3) - to estimate future yields.

81,Development of Methods for Decision-Making for Аgriculture Under Uncertainty,56,Chunmei J.," Abstract. In the context of growing human needs for food, an important issue is to increase the efficiency of agricultural enterprises. A modern tool for efficiency is the informatization of all processes, including the introduction of information systems to support decision-making. The objects and subjects of the environment in which the information system operates are determined, two mathematical models of the description of the decision-making problem in the conditions of uncertainty are offered. Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of decisions are defined. Keywords: decision making, uncertainly, information system. The growth of the planet's population leads to an increase in food needs. Initially, these needs could be met by using extensive methods to increase the area of land used in agar production. Now, this method cannot be applied in the vast majority of countries. Therefore, the first role is to increase the efficiency of available resources. To increase the efficiency of agricultural enterprises, there are two areas: technology and management. Management involves making more optimal and timely management decisions. Informatization of agricultural production processes gave an extraordinary impetus to the development of management. This process has begun recently and is undergoing a stage of exponential growth. Thus, according to BI Intelligence, the number of high- tech solutions in the agricultural sector, such as IoT, doubles every three years [1]. The amount of data that should be taken into account in decision-making is overgrowing, so there is a need to use information systems to support the decision making [2]. In [3], the authors considered the literature on the introduction of technology in agriculture with an emphasis on the role of uncertainty and learning. Factors influencing the benefits for farmers' adoption and their connection with the innovation process have been identified. The positive consequences of innovation and acceptance of welfare for farmers and consumers are also substantiated. The authors formalized the problem of decision-making in conditions of environmental uncertainty [4] proposed a conceptual information system that can be used to solve this problem [5]. We will divide the construction of the model of the information system of decision support in the agricultural sphere in the conditions of ecological uncertainty into four components: The goal-setting component. The principles component. Functionality component. Diagnostic component. The component of functionality primarily includes those mathematical models and methods that ensure the functioning of the information system to support decision- making in the agricultural sector in conditions of environmental uncertainty. We can consider two main approaches to determining the optimal solution. The first approach is to formulate the problem of decision making as a problem of multicriteria optimization: where x is a fuzzy vector value that represents the factors of the environmental conditions and economic conditions, s(x) is some strategy of the agricultural enterprise functionality, ci are criteria based on which the strategy can be evaluated, m is the number of criteria for evaluating the strategy of the agricultural enterprise functionality, Gj are functional restrictions that determine the feasibility of implementing a suitable strategy of the agricultural enterprise in terms of available resources and r is the number of restrictions/ Appropriate methods should be used to solve this problem of multicriteria optimization. The traditional approach is to use one of a family of local search methods. This method makes it possible to find local optimal solutions of the optimization problem. [6]. It is also traditional to use subgradient methods [7]. A more modern approach to solving optimization problems is simulation [8]. The second approach to decision making is to minimize risks [9]. To do this, first, there is the identification of risks, which consists in compiling a complete list of risks that may positively or negatively affect the activities of the agricultural enterprise. For this model, all fuzzy input parameters, namely environmental and economic conditions, are risk factors. Next is the analysis of risk distribution functions. The functions of losses or gains in the event of a relevant risk situation are assessed. Let f is a function of estimating losses or gains at a certain fixed value of some risk factor x . Then the overall expected effect from the activities of the agricultural enterprise can be calculated as a mathematical expectation: where xmin and xmin are the minimal and maximal possible values of the factor x and μ(x) is is a membership function. The risk of the activity is determined by the standard deviation: Since there are many risk factors, integration should be carried out for each of the risk factors. To find the optimal solution in terms of risk management is the solution of such a problem of minimizing the coefficient of variation Requirements for the properties of the final product and the result of the implementation of an information system to support decision-making in the agricultural sector in conditions of environmental uncertainty are described in [5]. Particular attention should be paid to the requirements for the modularity of the system. The advantage of using the modular structure of the system is the ability to expand and modify each of the modules independently of the others. This structure significantly increases the stability and flexibility of the system. A modern approach to software development such as the use of microservices should also be considered. Each module must be implemented as an independent microservice.

82,The Conceptual Project Management Model in the Sphere of E-Commerce Based on a Personalized Analysis,59,"Khlevnyi A., Kashapova L."," Abstract. Management of e-commerce projects, aimed at individual orders, is becoming increasingly valuable due to the transformation of business and consumer requirements. Combining project management methods and e-commerce tools to improve project management and implementation processes is most prioritized. For this purpose, a project management model of creation of an online business based on personalized analysis of the project information space was developed. The proposed approach can be used by companies that focus on innovative development. Keywords: E-commerce projects; Project management methodology The market for goods and services expresses a tendency to focus on the quality of the product or service itself due to increasing customer requirements. The growth of small business, which is aimed at meeting the individual needs of consumers, innovation, in terms of both new products or services, and from the standpoint of a new method of management force large companies to change their market strategies. This approach naturally follows from the market demand for product recognition among consumer buyers. Accordingly, in order to take a stable position in the market, it is necessary to apply advanced technologies to ensure the highest quality and provide effective positioning – branding, which relies solely on creating a unique image of the company. With the growth of e-commerce, it has become much easier to distribute goods and services and to obtain statistical information about consumers (customers) and their preferences. Due to the globalization of the Internet and the growing customer confidence in the field of e-commerce, local businesses have unlimited opportunities to promote their products or services and automate the receipt of orders for unique products. For example, a significant number of foreign companies have transformed their projects into a network, abandoning many traditional methods [1]. However, in the small business market, companies rarely utilize ""smart"" websites that would speed up the processing of customer orders and use the accumulated site statistics. The main reason of course is that it is usually associated with additional costs. Thus, ordinary websites do not contain order constructors, recommendations, and stakeholders face the procedure of long telephone interactions. Management becomes complicated without a clear information space of small business projects in the current conditions of e-commerce. Therefore, the field of e-commerce project management is becoming increasingly valuable because of the transformation of doing business. The current situation raises the need to form the approach for development of online business creation projects that is aimed at personalized orders. The proposed approach can be used by companies that focus on innovative development. Such projects are based on information analytics – the study of project management methodologies particularities, technological processes of production, and e-commerce tools utilization. The main goals of the project management methodology are effective planning, implementation, monitoring, and control, as well as bringing the project to successful completion, providing the project with the necessary set of methods [2, 3]. Project management methodology determines the direction of project development and helps to comply with the time and budget of the project, to form customer requirements, etc. Therefore, it is vital to choose a suitable project management methodology, to maximize the effectiveness in solving project tasks. Historically formed and functioning modern methodologies can be divided into traditional (rigid), agile (adaptive), and their synergy – hybrid methodologies [2-7]. It is advisable to use agile methodologies in the sphere of software development, as opposed to the confectionery industry, where both traditional and flexible methodologies can be used. The development of an ideal recipe and ingredients cost calculation to expand the range is peculiar to confectioneries that follow the traditional approach. As such, the traditional approach doesn't consider the client’s wishes. As opposed to the traditional approach, agile allows maintaining a floating assortment based on product features and gathered statistical information. Therefore, the relationship of project management models and methods with e- commerce processes in projects of personalized online orders is proposed to consider from the standpoint of the knowledge triad (Fig. 1). Figure 1 – Triad of knowledge in the development of a project of personalized orders It is advisable to form a specific methodology for project management to manage e-commerce projects characterized by distributing unique products through sites [8]. The conceptual project management model of the creation of an online business based on personalized orders and project information space analytics is presented in figure 2. The proposed model includes not only the processes of structuring the life cycle, project schedule, and organizational structure but also is based on information analysis – the study of project management methodologies, production processes, and e-commerce tools (Fig. 1 and 2). Figure 2 – Conceptual project management model of creation of an online business based on personalized orders Conclusion. The proposed project management model of creation of an online business based on personalized analysis of the project information space will allow to vastly reduce the project uncertainty. The application result of this model will be the analytics of personalized data for project quality management.

83,How Human Resources Processes Have Changed During the Pandemic,62,"Khlevnyi A., Nesterenko Ye."," Abstract. During the pandemic and quarantine, office workers were forced to switch to full or partial remote work. This has affected employee motivation and processes that have changed in the context of remote work. That is why the importance of HR (Human Resources) specialist has increased significantly during this period. Keywords: Human Recourses; Management System According to the Colliers International report [1], 23% of respondents said that motivation of employees has decreased. The achievement of the company's business performance and the competitiveness of the organization as a whole depend on the efficiency of the Human Resources (next - ""HR"") department. That is why great attention is paid to talent management and linking the goals of each employee to the strategic goals of the company, and thus increasing overall productivity. Today in Ukrainian companies most internal processes directly depend on the presence in the office, HR processes are no exception. For example, to sign a vacation application or a business trip, it is necessary to collect the physical signatures of the people involved in the process with an analogue copy of the document or order. With the onset of the pandemic, this became impossible. A similar example can be given about the recruitment process. In large companies, this process is performed by the HR department, reducing the share of tasks that affect employee motivation and the efficiency of the company as a whole. This process also requires a lot of approval through mail or messengers, which often leads to the loss of important information. To respond quickly to all the challenges and needs of society, as well as increase efficiency, companies must implement digital solutions that automate processes, including those related to HR. The automation of these processes should apply not only to primitive processes, such as payroll. These processes should maximize the unique potential of each employee and ensure the relevance of the personnel management system in the long run. If you analyze the IT infrastructure of companies and their needs, most of it can be reduced to the automation of document management and the implementation of appropriate systems. That's why more and more systems are appearing on the market that can increase efficiency and digitize all the processes that now work in companies only in physical offices. Consider one of the document automation tools. M-Files is an intelligent information management system [2] that implements powerful tools for finding, editing, sharing and organizing company content and information, with built-in artificial intelligence that can analyze data and build specific processes by analyzing them. It stores all the information in one place, which allows HR employees to always have the necessary document at hand, rather than looking for it among dozens of resources. HR specialists can search for documents not only by name but also by content, and be sure that their information is stored in complete security. The implementation of such systems requires careful preparation, as processes need to be set up appropriately so that data stored in multiple locations is available in a single repository. However, the implementation of such systems should not stop the company's work, as it may also bring additional losses. If we analyze the recruitment process in the company, you can identify the main stages, which can be automated the next way: An internal customer, like a manager in a company, who wants to find a new employee in his department, creates a request, which must be approved by the CEO. In the request, he indicates the basic information about the vacancy: who they are looking for, the necessary experience, skills, salary, etc. This application is approved by the head - the general manager. After approval, all the necessary information is automatically passed to the HR specialist, who collect the information that will be needed when searching for a candidate and publishes vacancies on job portals. The HR specialist gathers the database of candidates and initially processes them. If the candidate has successfully passed the screening, the HR specialist plans a technical interview with the internal customer - the manager of the department to which the candidate applied. Upon successful completion of all stages of interviews - the HR specialist generate a job offer for candidate. The HR specialist prepares all the necessary documents for the enrolment of the specialist in the company, conducts the onboarding process and prepares the material and technical support for the start of the specialist's work. Figure 1 – Recruitment process algorithm With each new vacancy the search begins on a clean slate - usually HR specialists simply do not have a single system with already collected resumes of candidates from previous times. The approving process of interviews, preparing an offer and contract, enrolling a candidate could be with errors and loss of important data. That's why there are several automation tools. Among specialized systems, the market leader is the HURMA service. HURMA - system for automation of HR processes and recruitment in a single structure [3]. But if the company has a corporate subscription to Microsoft 365, this process can be integrated into the existing IT infrastructure. Because Microsoft 365 [4] has many capabilities for communication (Microsoft Teams), data storage (OneDrive, SharePoint) and even analytics (PowerBI), additional system setup can automate the recruitment process described above. Conclusion. Thus, after analyzing the current situation, given the pandemic and the transition to remote work, the need for services to ensure the efficiency of business processes is necessary. Much of the work with documents, processes and people in the company falls on the shoulders of the HR-specialist, so it is especially important to optimize his work. There are quite a number of services and solutions that can reduce working hours, and therefore are the right tool on the way to digitalization of society.

84,Peculiarities of Project Team Management in a Remote Work Conditions,65,"Kontorer A., Khlevna Iu."," Abstract. With nowadays tendencies to switch to remote or hybrid work format, IT companies and projects face troubles and ineffectiveness when using the same methods of team project management, as when their employees worked offline. This paper proposes and describes actions that should be taken by remote team project managers to increase efficiency and probability of success of a project with a remote working team. Keywords: Digital project management, remote work, organizational structure. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, most IT companies have begun to view remote or hybrid work formats as acceptable. Globally, 16% of companies are fully remote according to an Owl labs study [1]. This same study found that about 62% of workers aged 22 to 65 claim to work remotely at least occasionally. In May 2021, a Mercer study found that 70% of companies said they were planning to adopt the hybrid model [2]. Many companies have already made the switch, including prominent brands such as Adobe, Salesforce, Spotify, and Twitter. Figure 1 shows the frequency of remote work after COVID-19 in the United States in 2020 [3]. However, the established management system in most cases was unprepared for such drastic changes, which led to a loss of communication efficiency within teams and departments of the company, reduced productivity, misunderstandings and the decline of team processes. Such changes have led to the need to create an effective remote management system for project teams, changes in approaches to communication, planning, reporting and more. The main problems faced by remote teams: Communication. The most common form of communication in remote work is text. But the text does not convey emotions well, the same phrase can be interpreted in dozens of ways. Misunderstandings, numerous edits and even conflicts are possible only because one of the employees did not read the letter or misunderstood it. Figure 1 - Remote work frequency before and after COVID-19 in the United States 2020 [3] Working day and work organization. We all live in different rhythms, and when a team starts working distributed, it is likely that each of its members will try to organize the working day in the most convenient way. When colleagues do not have the opportunity to contact each other at any time, the overall pace of the project slows down. This creates certain problems and delays the workflow. In addition, customers are often dissatisfied with not being able to receive prompt feedback. There are several key steps that will bring a project manager closer to effective remote team management [4]. Knowledge Base It consists of checklists for every task that all departments have or will have. All tasks that are repeated more than 2 times must be documented and described. Creation of the Knowledge Base basically includes two steps: Make a list of tasks for all departments;  Create a checklist (instruction) for each task. What is the main goal of checklists? Optimize work; Improve the quality of the task (when filling in checklists in detail); Reduce the time to complete the task; Speed up and simplify the process of training new employees (thus a new employee learns faster and more independently); If an employee quit, he leaves his experience (all the employee's work is documented). Who creates checklists? The specialist who performs the task; Checklist should be checked by the teamlead or head of the department, as it is in his competence; Checklists constantly need to be updated. Timeline of work Timeline of work on projects should be created after a list of tasks was drawn up. It is determined separately with the leader of each department. Time to complete tasks (deadlines) is determined jointly with the head of the department; it can be adjusted according to practice; Ordering and prioritization of tasks. At this point best practice is to use Gantt diagram; Formation and sorting of main tasks and subtasks; Appointment of responsible people for each task; All this is adjusted / optimized in operation; Team building. Team recruitment Next, a list of specialists should be formed from which the team will be built. The most important thing is that recruitment needs to go from tasks to hiring people, and not vice versa from recruiting a team to “inventing tasks for them”. Work planning Planning work for remote team has a number of nuances: Each employee has his own work plan for the day, week, month; CRM has tasks according to previously composed Timeline; In shared calendar there are all the main calls and work schedule; Weekly team call on Monday morning; Separate calls with each team lead at the beginning of the week to discuss all plans and results; Team leads call their specialists directly; Team meetings. Meetings Meetings are good and necessary, but they often can be a waste of time. Protracted meetings lead to demotivation and ineffective waste of time for employees and company or department leaders. Steps to optimization of meetings: Meetings should be held as little as possible. For example: once a week with each department head or team lead. Team leads are already working closely with their team. Work on optimizing the team's work (here: team structure, checklists, training, etc.), then there will be less of what needs to be said every time; Learn to delegate. Personal conversations Personal conversations as a form of team communication should be considered on a regular basis. Each employee should have an opportunity to share their feedback about team members, team lead, management, and make suggestions for improving their workflow and environment. In general, the use of the proposed approaches in team management of remote teams is aimed at improving the efficiency of project teams that work separately during the COVID-19 pandemic. The above helps to increase the probability of success of a project with a remote or hybrid work model and describes steps to building effective and optimised project team management.

85,An Approach to Build a Decentralized Collection of Business Process Models,68,"Kopp A., Orlovskyi D., Orekhov S."," Abstract. In this study we have proposed the approach to organization of decentralized blockchain-based business process model repository that could be used to provide secure software solution to store and access the business process model collection in a tamper-resistant manner. Keywords: Business Process Model, Blockchain, Repository, Knowledge Sharing, Smart Contract. Current trend of the digital transformation encourages large enterprises, medium- size companies, and even small businesses to focus on detection, analysis, and improvement of their business processes by deploying BPM (Business Process Management) suites that automate routine activities. Such approach is known as BPM, while described cycle of continuous process improvement is referred as BPM lifecycle. Business processes are considered as structured sequences of activities performed by employees and other stakeholders in order to transform raw information or materials into products or services valuable for customers, either external or internal. For example, sick leave application is processed to satisfy an internal customer – an employee who requested the sick leave, while order processing serves to an external customer – a company’s client or a counter-party organization, which requires order fulfilment. Each of such business scenarios are called as business processes and, traditionally for BPM projects, are represented using graphical models (similar to flowcharts used to describe algorithms) in order to capture, store, and share knowledge about organizational activities. Captured knowledge about ongoing business processes represented in the form of graphical schemes could be used to train new employees (future process participants) or to detect inefficiencies in workflows to improve organizational activities through business process automation (replacing manual routine tasks with scripts) or re-engineering (rebuilding whole business process scenarios from scratch). Thus, it is natural for big enterprises to have extremely large collections of hundreds or even thousands [1] of business process models. Keeping and accessing such volumes of business process models could be possible with the use of enterprise- level techniques and software solutions. Since availability, integrity, and security are crucial features for enterprise collections of business process models, in this paper we consider usage of a blockchain technology to keep and manage business process models in the secure and stable manner. According to Yan et al. [1], managing enormous collections of business process models is a complex problem indeed, which requires special software tool to store, search, and manage business process model versions [1]. Such software was called a “business process model repository” [1] and, according to Elias [2], it should correspond to the particular requirements, e.g. support of a standard business process modeling notation, displaying of both graphical and textual process descriptions, provision of multiple model versions for the same process, model search and categorization, model analysis and comparison, support of relationships between business process models etc. However, there are external access and security [2] requirements, which fulfillment is critical for corporate assets. Access control and integrity control features were also mentioned by La Rosa et al. [3], as capabilities of an advanced business process model repository software named “APROMORE” [3]. Also, access, integrity, and, in addition, transaction management features were mentioned as part of the framework for business process model repositories proposed by Yan and Grefen [4]. Researches made in this time period are devoted to efficient querying of business process models, stored in a repositories, using graph-based data structures and indexing approaches similar to search engines [5, 6], and comparison of business process models using various similarity measures based on business process structure and semantic [7, 8]. Nevertheless, all of these studies have mentioned accessibility and security as repository features, but not as their main research objectives. Since the crypto-boom of 2017, a blockchain technology went far beyond the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, even though it was initially designed to fit digital currency requirements, such as forgery resistance, immutability, and decentralized community- backed governance [9]. Originally created to implement cryptocurrencies, the blockchain technology works with transactions (e.g. containing recipient’s address, number of coins to be sent, and sender’s signature), which are consolidated into blocks that contain hash values of blocks generated before, by which creating a chain of irreversible and immutable blocks [10]. Therefore, data authenticity and consistency could be proven by checking conformity of hash values back to the initial block of the whole blockchain [10]. Thus, blockchain transactions do not need a “trusted entity” for processing, they could be executed fast and at low cost, cannot be tampered, and could be easily traces [11]. Such benefits could not be unnoticed by industry and to support business process execution on top of blockchains, “smart contracts” were introduced as the computer programs that run in the blockchain platform and record results of their execution as immutable transaction into the blockchain [11]. Being a blockchain platform, Ethereum represents a peer-to-peer network of nodes that maintain a distributed ledger of transactions, whereas its main purpose is a “world computer” that runs smart contracts as general-purpose computer programs created using Solidity language similar to JavaScript by means of its syntax [12]. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and other platforms that support smart contracts are called as “programmable blockchains”, which are used to create decentralized applications or “DApps” [12]. DApps use smart contracts as back-end code and blockchains as databases in contrast to traditional applications backed by centralized servers, whereas the frontend of DApps is usually created with traditional combination of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript together with the “web3.js” library is used to access Ethereum API (Application Programming Interface) [12]. By April 2021, there are five leading smart contract platforms that could be used as “programmable blockchains”: Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, EOS, and Binance Smart Chain, however, Ethereum is still the major player and its future development may cement it as the dominant smart contract platform once and for all [13]. Considering relatively young age of a blockchain-based BPM, there are mostly proof-of-concept or experimental solutions currently exist (i.e. Caterpillar and others [14]). These solutions consider cross-organizational performance of business processes supported on top of blockchain platforms. However, for our best knowledge, the enterprise knowledge sharing approach using a blockchain platform and the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) process modeling standard was not proposed yet. Hence, using programmable blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, there could be created a decentralized application to store and manage collections of business process models as part of the inter-organizational repository of corporate knowledge (see Figure 1). Figure 1 – Conceptual model of a blockchain-based business process model repository According to the conceptual model shown above in Figure 1, a blockchain-based repository of BPMN models could be implemented as multiple smart contracts: a main smart contract, which addresses one or several smart contracts that represent collections of business process models. As the frontend should be created a decentralized web application that will get the registry of process model collection from the main smart contract and access respective collections of BPMN models. Therefore, such repository may contain multiple business process models collections owned by different organizations or individuals supporting this enterprise knowledge sharing initiative. We have selected the Ethereum blockchain platform for smart contract implementation because of its dominance in the area [13], Turing complete programming language Solidity [12], and availability of development tools: Remix IDE (Integrated Development Environment), Ropsten Ethereum test network, MetaMask wallet for interaction with the Ethereum network. Created web application prototype shows a decentralized application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together with the “web3.js” library to work with the smart contract. The source code of developed decentralized application is available at [15].

86,The Choice of Information Technology on Improving the Accuracy of the Signal Synchronization Received by The Radio Technical System,72,"Kozlovskyi V., Turovsky O., Boiko Yu., Klobukov V."," Improving the efficiency of communication systems largely depends on the quality of operation of systems and devices that are part of them, as well as on the processes and methods of transmission, reception and processing of useful signal, which are directly related to signal modulation - changing carrier parameters in depending on the level of the transmitted signal. Satellite communication systems mainly use angular modulation, which is free from the disadvantages associated with the technical complexity of systems that use amplitude modulation. When angular modulation, the transmission of information is carried out by changing the phase and frequency of the carrier. However, a serious disadvantage of angular modulation should be considered that the transmission of a unit of information requires a wider range of frequencies than amplitude modulation. Angular modulation can be in the form of frequency or phase modulation. Regardless of the type of angular modulation, its implementation requires synchronization of the input signal, which is carried out by the corresponding synchronization systems. For example, in phase-coherent telecommunications and control systems, they are used to restore carrier and clock frequencies and for coherent demodulation of analog and digital signals with angular modulation [1]. The choice of information technologies of optimization and substantiation of the rational scheme of synchronization which would provide to reduce a dispersion of constant and transient errors in the course of tracking of carrier frequency in the presence of noise in the communication channel at angular demodulation of a signal. the problem to which this work is devoted [2]. The paper presents the results of selection and substantiation of information technologies for the construction and application of the scheme of synchronization of the input signal by the phase-coherent communication system in the angular demodulation of the signal transmitted by the satellite communication system [3,4]. As an information technology for the construction of synchronization systems, the article proposes an invariant approach, which determines the possibility of the schemes of construction of the synchronization system presented in the article to increase the order of astatism. The analysis of closed and combined synchronization systems carried out in the article, on the basis of the offered information technology, showed expediency of application of the specified approach at the decision of a problem on increase of accuracy of synchronization of carrier frequency of a signal at angular demodulation. Analysis of closed synchronization systems showed that when designing such a system with a minimum of phase error in the angular demodulation of the signal, such a system is characterized by a large transient error [5]. It is shown that taking into account the additive Gaussian noise and instability of generators, the desire to minimize the variance of the phase error in the class of closed synchronization systems causes a deterioration of the system dynamics and does not increase the order of astatism. The combined synchronization system with open communication is a synthesized invariant system, has the ability to increase the order of astatism, and is able to minimize the phase error in the angular demodulation of the signal. It is established that in the conditions of instantaneous phase or frequency change it is possible to improve the system dynamics and reduce the transient component of the phase error variance by selecting the parameters of the open link in the direction of suppressing their values of the corresponding roots of the transient characteristic equation. The selection of open communication parameters in combined synchronization systems can affect the transmission function and thus ensure the minimization of constant and transient errors of the system without affecting the dynamics of the system. The direction of further research initiated in this article may be the synthesis of open communication in combined synchronization systems in the presence of restrictions on input coordinates and the assessment of the sensitivity of such a system to the deviation of open channel parameters during input signal synchronization.

87,Taking Into Account a Priori Uncertainty in the Model of Maintenance of Objects With Time Redundanc,74,"Kredentser B., Mogylevych D., Kononova I., Subach I."," Abstract. The processes of functioning of technical renewable objects of continuous use, restored and serviced, in which time reservation is provided. The problem of obtaining analytical relations for the limit values of the optimal periodicity of service and the corresponding extreme values of quality indicators in conditions of a priori uncertainty (limited source information) is formulated. A general approach to solving the problem is proposed, which will allow to obtain results that are convenient for practical calculations. Keywords: Maintenance, prior uncertainty, temporary redundancy. The analysis of a number of publications of domestic and foreign specialists indicates a decrease in attention to the issues of researching the reliability and maintenance of complex technical systems, in particular telecommunications equipment of communication networks [1]. The results known in this subject area are devoted to the study of mainly traditional methods of maintenance and are obtained, as a rule, without a complex consideration of a set of factors that significantly affect the efficiency of maintenance. These factors include the usage of various types of redundancy, which is a necessary condition for ensuring the reliability of the functioning of almost any technical system. In well-known publications, such factors are not always taken into account that characterize the modes of usage of objects for their intended purpose, as well as the parameters of the flows of failures and equipment recovery. All this leads to results that are difficult to use in practice. The subject of the study are technical facilities with time redundancy (systems ""object time""), which provide for periodic maintenance [1, 2, 3]. In contrast to the work [4], the article considers continuous use systems, examples of which are telecommunication systems of communication networks, automated control systems (ACS) for various purposes and other systems. In addition, the study of these systems is carried out in conditions of a priori uncertainty, which means incomplete source information about the laws of distribution of determinants of random variables, when the exact type of these distribution functions is not specified, and only some numerical characteristics of random variables are known. The purpose of the article is to substantiate a general approach to the study of maintenance of the mentioned above class of technical objects under conditions of limited initial information about the distribution function of the object recovery time and the distribution function of the maintenance execution time (only two initial moments of these random variables are known), which allows one to obtain design relations for two-way estimates (lower and upper bounds) of the optimal frequency of maintenance and the corresponding extreme values of quality indicators, values of service quality indicators: the maximum value of the coefficient of technical utilization of the facility and the minimum value of the average unit costs. The given theoretical research of process of maintenance of objects with time reservation allows to draw the following conclusions: the proposed approach to take into account the a priori uncertainty (incompleteness of the source information) when building a model of maintenance of objects of continuous use allowed to obtain relatively easy analytical formulas for quality indicators of maintenance, convenient for practical use. These relationships establish a relationship between the quality indicators and reliability characteristics of the object, the values of periodicity and duration and the parameters of time redundancy; taking into account in the developed model the parameters of time redundancy (allowable time of recovery and maintenance) the ability of objects to function normally under the influence of various destabilizing factors (failures, equipment failures, etc.). It is the presence of time reserve, which is a system parameter, that can in many cases explain why objects perform their functions more successfully than is the result of equipment failure.

88,Project Management of Creation and Implementation of Electronic Documentation System,76,"Kriuchek D., Yehorchenkov O."," Abstract. This thesis contains a consideration of document management automation problems and an exploration of electronic document management implementation. Keywords: project management, automation, document flow, digital signature. In the age of internet technology, all processes are being automated. Not so long ago, it was impossible to imagine a world where an email was sent to a friend in two clicks on one's smartphone and a reply arrived in a matter of seconds. This is exactly how the process of correspondence was once automated. Getting rid of paper documents is an urgent need every year, as important documents get damaged and lost over time, severely impacting business processes. The solution to this problem is the transition to electronic document management which allows you to exchange any documents with your counterparties and also gives legal effect to the documents by signing them with digital signature. With the help of an electronic document management service, time and money for sending documents will be saved significantly, as everything will happen in a matter of minutes and there will be no costs for paper, printing or delivery services. At the moment there are several services in Ukraine that implement electronic document management. [1,2] However, after analyzing the competitors presented in Table 1, it became clear that they have a number of disadvantages and none of them allows secure document exchange without a software download and with the possibility of integration with other systems. Table 1 Thus, there is an urgent issue of project management for the creation and implementation of an electronic document management system that would provide an electronic document exchange service in Ukraine. The product of the project [3] is expected to be a website and a mobile application for Android and iOS aimed at legal and natural persons who have access to the Internet and need to exchange legally relevant documents. Among the list of the main tasks of the project to be solved to achieve the set objectives are: to justify the necessity and expediency of this service, to analyze competitors; to make a series of presentations to attract investors; to raise capital for the project implementation; to develop a convenient website design and implement the link between the website and the application; to analyze existing software development technologies and determine the quality standard of the product; to conduct an advertising campaign; to form a team to develop the service with minimum labor costs; ensure effective communication within the team; implement electronic document management at 2 sites within the first 6 months. This project will solve a number of problems encountered when working with paper documents, namely their damage due to weather conditions or human error; their complete loss. By working on the site, users will be able to work anywhere in the world. Integration with other systems will be available to quickly switch to our service. The project is divided into phases that create the project life cycle in order to ensure that the project is carried out within the given constraints. It consists of 5 phases: Initiation, Project Planning, Development, Progress Control, Project Closeout. In the project inception phase (project initiation and planning), the following tasks are identified: start-up organization (conducting problem analysis and identification; problem tree construction; impact analysis); formulation of project alternatives; development of project certificate and project statute. The main phase in the life cycle is development. During this phase, the main task is to develop the service, to monitor the work done, project managers present a monthly report with a list of changes for investors, conduct training to improve the skills of employees, conduct presentations to achieve the goal of implementing the product in 2 companies, and launch an advertising campaign to attract users. With the development and implementation of this service, customers can order a package of 100 documents free of charge and experience all the benefits of electronic document management, thus attracting more users. It is planned to get profit from sales of the package of documents, besides enterprises have an opportunity to order special functions, which will improve work with the service, for additional payment. The analysis shows that there are already services in place that implement electronic document management. The main problem is that they need to download software to do this. We, on the other hand, offer to work on a website, which allows exchange even in their smartphones. Consequently, this service will be useful for both individual users and large enterprises. Conclusions. The analysis presented on Ukrainian market electronic document management systems showed that they have shortcomings. Implementation of the proposed project will create a competing information system with unique functionality. In the paper the strengths of the project and opportunities for further development was determined. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the weaknesses of the project and try to solve them with the strengths, as well as build appropriate response strategies to prevent the emergence of risks.

89,Features of the Project to Develop an Application to Detect Fake Counterfeits,79,"Kupchyk Ye., Fesiuk V., Kolesnikova K."," Abstract. The article describes the problem of combating counterfeiting and offers a solution by developing a project to detect counterfeits. Keywords: Counterfeit, Brands, Black Market, Original, Manufacturers, Sellers. The market of resale of goods is very developed and gaining momentum. People want to buy quality products at attractive prices and excellent quality. But it is not always possible to find the necessary products on the official websites of brands, or a particular brand may not be officially represented in some countries. Therefore, people often turn to reliable resellers (people who buy branded items and resell them). But at this point there is an urgent question about the quality of goods, because resellers can confirm this only in their own words. It is well known that there is a large proportion of sellers who sell counterfeits and pass them off as authentic goods. At the same time, counterfeiters make goods that are difficult to distinguish from authentic ones [3]. This problem in the reselling market raises an important question: how to determine the authenticity of goods and assure customers of their quality [2]. The project involves the creation of a mobile application to identify authentic branded products, which will help users to check things before buying for originality, ie whether it is counterfeit [1]. The coronavirus pandemic has become a catalyst for e-commerce. Quarantine, self-isolation, curfew, restrictions on movement - all these measures have led to the fact that the lion's share of goods humanity now orders online. Clothing, appliances, cosmetics, food and even medicine - all this is now bought online, as evidenced by numerous studies to increase the share of e-commerce in the global market, but at the same time, the market has become more fraudulent, who brazenly sell counterfeits under the guise of quality and original products [2]. This problem can be solved by creating a tool that will determine the authenticity of goods. This tool will serve as a means of determining quality for buyers, as well as a means of quality assurance for sellers [1]. Since the need to purchase quality goods is high, this area is quite promising. The application will not lose its relevance due to the fact that the number of counterfeits is dynamically increasing, and their similarity with authentic goods complicates the analysis of buyers for originality and quality [3]. So, in times of rapid development of e-commerce, when buyers are not physically able to verify the authenticity of the product before buying, our application ""Pal`off"" comes in handy (fig. 3). Figure 4 – The prototype of the product It will help both buyers who can scan the product in the application to verify its authenticity, and bona fide sellers who will be able to add a certificate of analysis of the product for authenticity, because such certificates are generated by our application. After analyzing the subject area and market of similar products and technical solutions, we can conclude that our product is unique because it allows you to test specific clothes in real time using artificial intelligence (without waiting for manual verification). However, the Legit App, which is presented on the market, has the option of forming a certificate of quality assurance, which can be used when selling things. This functionality is interesting because this confirmation can be used by resellers as a sign of quality, so that the user does not verify the authenticity of the thing further.

90,Features of Project Management of Development and Implementation of the System Using Cloud Calculation for Remote Gaming,81,"Kushlianskyi D., Morozov V."," Currently, the field of gaming in Ukraine and around the world is going through difficult times. First of all, due to the introduction of strict regulation of many plants and production lines, as well as disruption of supply chains has led to a shortage of products containing semiconductors, such as: automotive multimedia systems, home appliances, and computer hardware, on which, of course, remains in extremely high demand [1]. This situation, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, is exacerbated by the increased demand for video cards, which, although an integral part of any gaming station, have recently been increasingly used to extract virtual cryptocurrencies, the extraction process of which is highly dependent on the capacity of the computing power or the number of video cards. Third, most video game development studios, including Ukrainian ones, are also forced to suffer losses due to unwillingness to optimize the development process in the mode of partial or complete isolation of teams [2], which forces publishers to increase prices for their products, for example, the AAA-game price last year increased by an average of 16% [3]. The fourth reason is an ideological continuation of the third. Unfortunately, a very attractive way out of this situation for many is piracy, which exacerbates the problem even more. The increase in prices for digital products, as well as for hardware, determines the price insolvency of a potential customer who will be looking for alternatives. The secondary gaming market may be a good alternative, but there is currently no specialized service among Ukrainian marketplaces that would be geared towards gamers. Analyzing the above reasons for the decline of the gaming industry in Ukraine, we can highlight the following [4]: Lack of hardware at recommended retail prices in electronics stores causes shortages of components Rising game prices are repelling potential buyers The project envisages the creation of an Internet service that will provide users with remote protocols and firewalls protected access to virtual capacity through a cloud computing infrastructure. Each player will be allocated a separate slot from the entire cluster. Access to the functionality of the service will be provided on various platforms, including: from a browser, from a mobile device on the Android platform using the application, from an iOS device using Progressive Web Application technology, and from a desktop application on Linux, MacOS and Windows platforms. The service supports several monetization options and offers users the following usage options: free access, in which the game session is limited to 1 hour of gameplay, monthly subscription, and annual subscription, which offer the best graphics settings and priority in the queue. Figure 1. Forecasting the market share of cloud gaming services in the United States The COVID-19 pandemic has had a positive impact on the growth of the cloud gaming market. The majority of the population is quarantined at home due to the pandemic, and search engines offer many interactive games on their home page, trying to entice users.

91,Development of a System of Protection Against Sale of Counterfeit Drugs in Pharmacies,83,"Kuziv T., Bovsunovskyi K., Latysheva T."," Annotation. The article describes the problem of combating drug falsification and proposes its solution by developing a system for detecting counterfeits. Keywords: system, pharmacies, datamatrix, protect, counterfeits, Waterfall Introduction. According to the World Congress of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences FIP, the issue of counterfeit drugs is global. Poor quality and counterfeit medical devices can harm patients and not cure the diseases for which they are intended. It is estimated that 1 in 10 medical devices in low- and middle-income countries are substandard or counterfeit. They lead to a loss of confidence in medicines, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems [2]. The aim of the research. The research will reveal the topic of developing an information system for protection against counterfeiting of medicines, which has no analogues in the world. The purpose of this work is to develop a system of protection against the sale of counterfeits in pharmacies. The system should provide for the use of unique identification keys to identify drugs. Therefore, the research of such processes seems relevant and appropriate, and the goal requires its solution. Basic material. Poor quality and counterfeit medical devices are difficult to detect by nature. They are often designed to look identical to the real product and may not cause an obvious side effect, but they often cannot properly treat the disease or condition for which they were intended and can lead to serious health consequences, including death [2]. The best way to actually protect yourself from counterfeiting in the future is to create a system that will address this issue quickly and efficiently. Description of the system: Before placing batches in the market, the drug manufacturer must provide the drug codes to be entered into the system database, print a 2D code (DataMatrix) that includes a unique identifier and apply an anti-counterfeiting device on the outer packaging of all drugs for each package. Before selling each package, the pharmacist has to scan the barcode of the medication. The information is sent to the database and the code is checked [Figure 1]. Figure 1: Product flow Conclusions. Therefore, the system of protection against counterfeiting in pharmacies favors stakeholders in terms of drug quality. The pharmacy will receive quality drugs, thereby increasing its reputation and the number of customers. Manufacturers will increase competitiveness in the market through the sale of its own original drugs. The state will increase the level of health care in the country. Customers will be able to be confident in the quality of their medicines and avoid health risks. The system design project involves a long development period and the presence of a development team. The Waterfall methodology has been assigned for the planned process of marketing. This model is used in the medical development field, as it is a strictly disciplined domain. Waterfall is easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model – each phase has specific deliverables and a review process, and phases are processed and completed one at a time [3]. In the future, it is possible to consider additional ideas for the development team, such as creating a mobile application, desktop application and web-application based on the developed system. If the system is successful, and it is decided to expand it, new development teams may appear and work in parallel. In this way, the system of protection against counterfeiting in pharmacies as an idea will be able to protect the health of consumers and the reputation of manufacturers and pharmacies. With quality medicines on the market, consumers will be able to be sure that there are no counterfeits in the pharmacy and to avoid harm to health.

92,Algorithm for Increasing the Stability Level of Cryptosystems,85,"Kvyetnyy R., Ivanchuk Ya., Yarovyi A., Horobets Yu."," Abstract. The article considers the types of DSA and ECDSA cryptosystems affected by side channel attacks. A method for identifying the type of impact based on lattice attacks has been developed, which showed that if there are common bits in ephemeral keys, the sender's private key can be restored in polynomial time. As countermeasure this attack an ephemeral key generation algorithm was developed, using a deterministic signature and a constant-time modular inverse algorithm. Keywords: lattice, shared bits, modular inverse, constant-time, deterministic signature, cryptosystems Introduction For some encryption systems, an ephemeral key (nonce) is used, which is needed to add more complexity to the encryption algorithm, the main requirement for it, the ephemeral key must be used only once. For DSA, ElGamal, ECDSA [1, 2] encryption systems - when creating encrypted messages, an ephemeral key is additionally used, which in turn leads to attacks on side channels, FLUSH+RELOAD ephemeral key data [3], attacks on the pseudo-random number generator [4], using oscillograph for timings attack [5], using masked digital signal [6]. All of these attack types result in the substitution or interception of individual bits of ephemeral key data, giving third parties access to encrypted messages, which in turn compromises the sender's secret key. A particularly dangerous cryptoattack types are side channel attack, which allow, by analyzing the time of generation of the ephemeral key, to find the most or least significant bits of the ephemeral key. Then using special methods the sender's private key is searched. The aim of the work is to increase the degree of protection of the process of information exchange in system networks on the basis of the developed effective data encryption algorithm. To achieve this goal it is necessary to determine the vulnerability type of cryptosystems to sidechannel attack, as well as to develop an effective method protection cryptosystems from sidechannel attack to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted information. Assume that an attacker was able to collect n-number encrypted messages mi (i=1, …, n) with the associated signatures (ri, si), where all the corresponding ephemeral keys ki shared total ◻ bits between more significant (MSB) and less significant (LSB) bits independent of i. In this way, they will meet the following dependency for all i=1, ..., n: k  k  2t k~  2t' k ' , (1) where 0  k  2t ,0  k '  2N t ',     t ' t,0  k  2N  , with k and k´ common for all ki. It should be noted that the values of the variables n-ої of equations (2), which define the signature: m1  ar1  s1k1  0 (mod q); m2  ar2  s2 k2  0 (mod q);  ki , k, k~ , k ' are unknown. In the (2) m  ar  s k  0 (mod q),  n n n n where mi – message, a – signer private key, ri – numerical value of the first part of the signature, si – numerical value of the second part of the signature, ki – ephemeral key, i- message index. If in the system of equations (2) replace the parameters mi, ri, si with the value (1) and eliminate common variables k and k′, then we obtain: (s 1m  s 1m )  a(s 1r  s 1r )  2t (k~  k~ )  0(mod q); 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 (s 1m  s 1m )  a(s 1r  s 1r )  2t (k~  k~ )  0(mod q); (3)  1 1 3 3 1 1 3 3 1 3   1 1 t ~ ~ (s1 m1  sn mn )  a(s1 r1  sn rn )  2 (k1  kn )  0(mod q).

However, the norm υ0 is lower bounded by secret key a, which can be an integer of approximately N bits. Then the next element of the vector υ0 next ones, which are N - ◻ integers. is much larger than the The developed approach to obtaining access to private keys from signed messages proves that the DSA (ECDSA) algorithm is vulnerable to side-channel attack, in case when the ephemeric keys of each encrypted message have shared bits in less and/or more significant bits. To prevent these types of attacks, it is necessary to change the existing ephemeral key generation algorithm to deterministic to avoid generating similar or the same ephemeral keys that would immediately compromise the signer’s private key. To achieve this goal, a new function for generating an ephemeral key which will receive a message (m) and private key of the sender (d), is proposed. This function use of additional hash function that follows the integrity of the data, and mixes the ephemeral key for greater randomness. Also, one of the vulnerable points in the creation of signatures is a modular inverse operation in the algorithm 2 [9]. The execution time of the algorithm 2 depends on both values a and b,namely the number of iterations of the While cycle, as well as the degree of two, which should be removed in the end of the algorithm, are significantly different for input data. Therefore, to convert an algorithm 2 into an algorithm performed by a constant time for a given wn bit module m, it is necessary to save the following requirements: One iteration is always calculated by the same amount of time, it means to calculate all four branches from the algorithm 2 and select the correct values for a constant time. This ensures that the time of execution of one iteration does not depend on the branch taken, but means that the calculation time increases until the calculation of all branches; The algorithm must perform the one-time number of iterations (for a constant time), which means that it is necessary to calculate the worst number of 2wn iterations. This can be realized by determining when the algorithm 2 is completed (when v = 1). Depending on this condition, we create a bit mask and choose the input value for this iteration (when v =1), or the value, calculation with iteration with constant time (v≠1). Conclusions The vulnerability type of cryptosystems is determined for side channel attack, which is concluded in blocking the bits of the ephemeral key or determining the signature time of each message. Using the developed method, the signers private key can be determined in the presence of a sufficient number of messages in less than a minute, bypassing a discrete logarithm problem, which in turn fully compromises the stability of cryptosystems. Was developed a effective method for protecting cryptosystems to attack by side channels to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted information, based on a new ephemeral key generation algorithm to prevent attacks by side channels, which increases the count a mathematical operation to 2N. The use of the developed constant time algorithm of modular inverse, provides a constant number of clock cycles, namely, the number of bits of 256, the number of cycles will not be constant 50-60. When using this algorithm, the number of clock cycles is always 486, which provides resistant to the attack.

93,Project management platform for international research and development,89,Li M.," Implementing an agile method means that you will not abandon actual project operation processes, but the nature of project implementation may eventually alter dramatically [1]. Is a essential aspect of agile models, which is utmost useful for all types of business projects. An venture project is often characterized by the fact that it is challenging to accurately predict in advance. Some areas of activity later in the project are relatively impossible to assess aforetime the project participators have seen the decisions and projects made earlier. As a result, attempts to be predictive on a large scale are often a high risk for such projects. From the other hand, an adaptive approach to evolving early stages and returns to improve the project over and over again manage to be much farther effective. Returning to the approach of moving wave planning, as outlined in the PMBOK® Guide [2, 3], has the potential to be of big benefit. The Yanchen Polytechnic Institute is no exception, which integrates the latest accomplishments in project and program operation with educational and scientific processes. The Agile mechanism - iterative and gradual evolvement - is widely used to implement international joint projects. This approach is very significant in the context of national differences and the location of project executors in different countries. In particular, when performing cooperative research for client companies. There is a project operation structure - Kanban [4]. Main research results One of the main challenges for project managers using the Agile methodic is to take human factors into account, focusing on the talents and skills of individuals. If the people in the project are qualified enough, they can use different approaches to complete the assignment. Agile is aimed at contingentwork, with maximum use of individual talents to effectively achieve the goal [5]. For Agile methodic , it is practiced to use a workflow visualization tool to display the status of project assignments. The Odoo complex is used for joint projects between Ukrainian research institutions and the Yanchen Polytechnic Institute. Odoo is a set of open source software that covers all the company's needs: CRM, e-commerce, accounting, warehouse, point of sale, project operation and farther. The uniqueness of Odoo lies in the ease of use and full integration [6-13]. Figure 1 The menu for creating project assignments in the Odoo complex, which was used to implement a simple scientific topic ""Development of a gas cleaning device for ventilation complexes of industrial premises."" The assignments are detailed in a specialized menu, which is presented in Figure 2. The Kanban board of the simple scientific topic “Development of a gas cleaning device for ventilation complexes of industrial premises” is presented in Figure 3. As an example, the article presents a assignment board for the implementation of a simple scientific topic ""Development of a gas cleaning device for ventilation complexes of industrial premises"", which is commissioned by a Chinese company. The main performers are two parties - Chinese and Ukrainian. The client is directly involved in the project as a party with whom every result of the sprint - backlog. Using an integrated project operation platform minimizes backlog approval time. Performance on the project by contingents in different parts of the world is without delay, which makes the implementation of such projects competitive in the international market of research services.

94,Development of Methods for Diversification Strategies Choice in Building Entrprise,92,Li Yu.," Annotation. The diversification of construction companies is relevant due to the significant development of the construction industry in the last decade in Ukraine, China, and the world. The article describes some well-known decision-making methods for the problem of choosing diversification strategies. The article defines the general requirements for the development of information technology strategy selection. Problems that need to be addressed in future research have also been identified. Keywords: decision making; building enterprise; multi-objective optimization. It was found that the main factors influencing the activities of a construction company are: environmental factor (presence of competitors, partnerships with other companies, joining regional clusters); the factor of the enterprise's strategic management, particularly the productivity of the enterprise, organizational structure of the enterprise, etc. The analysis of construction companies in Ukraine reveals 40% of companies operating in the framework of horizontal diversification strategies, 27% there are invisible strategies, 9% are vertical strategies, and almost 24%, but there is no strategy of interaction. The article [1] states that the theory of adaptive strategic management is broad and exists in the corresponding diversification strategy. This theory includes several tools that allow to dynamically regulate the activities of enterprises, taking into account those that are necessary. The calculation of these indicators is a complex task associated with the conditions of risk and uncertainty in which the construction company operates. Globalization of markets and unstable economic conditions are conditions that complicate the process of choosing a diversification strategy. However, without this choice, the company may eventually lose revenue and eventually lose resources to operate. That is why the task of choosing strategies for diversification of construction companies, which would provide the opportunity to obtain the maximum economic effect, is an urgent task of the study. One of the effective methods of multi-criteria decision-making is the method of analysis of hierarchies [2]. The method is simple but requires a large amount of additional information, which is challenging to implement under uncertainty. Article [3] describes the use of the MAUT (Multi-Attribute Utility Theory) method for multi- criteria decision-making and risk assessment. The method can be used to select diversification strategies, as it considers the uncertainty of the data, but the advantages of alternatives in pairwise comparison must be strict. Consider the conceptual model of choice of diversification strategies, the scheme of which is shown in Figure 1. The main components of the conceptual model are the definition of criteria for selecting diversification strategies, the application of a multi-criteria optimization method, building the benefits of diversification strategies, decision-making on the choice of strategy by the decision-maker. According to the presented concept, the main stages of deciding on the choice of diversification strategies are as follows: Formation of a preliminary list of diversification strategies. Defining criteria for selecting diversification strategies. Application of the method of multi-criteria optimization to select a set of optimal diversification strategies. Formation of advantages of diversification strategies. Defining a ranked list of potential diversification strategies. The final choice of diversification strategies for implementation at the construction company. Figure 5 – The conceptual scheme for solving the problem of choosing diversification strategies. Let B be a construction company that builds real estate and organizes the appropriate processes. Company B's organizational structure, peculiarities of activity, and history of the creation of projects and construction objects are known. We believe that the company's activities take place in conditions of uncertainty and risk. Let Company B's research show that some diversification strategy is needed to increase profits and reduce risks. Many diversification strategies or acceptable alternatives have been developed: The company can implement strategies, i.e., company B has sufficient financial and human resources, n is the number of possible diversification strategies [5]. To evaluate the strategies, consider the vector criterion where 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆, m is the number of criteria for evaluating alternatives. Each of the criteria can have 𝑤1, 𝑤2, … 𝑤𝑚, determining the importance of each criterion in evaluating alternatives, The aim is to determine a rational diversification strategy from a set of acceptable alternatives 𝑗𝑗 = 1, 𝑘, 𝑘 < 𝑛 over a given criterion space, given the uncertainty. The result can be a rational strategy of diversification 𝑠∗ . The result can also be an ordered set of strategies [4]: If 𝑠𝑗𝑗 are diversification strategies, 𝑗𝑗 = 1, 𝑛, 𝑐𝑖 are criteria, 𝑤𝑖 are weighting factors of criteria, 𝑖 = 1, 𝑚, 𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑗 are evaluations of diversification strategies according to certain criteria. That is, estimates are functions If 𝐼 = {1,2, … , 𝑚} is the set of all indices, is the set of indexes of objective functions that are maximized, is the set of indexes of objective functions that are minimized, 𝐼 = 𝐼+ ∪ 𝐼−. Then the problem can be written as follows [20]: Therefore, to solve the problem of making a multi-criteria decision in choosing strategies for diversification of construction companies, it is necessary to develop the following multi-criteria method or decision-making methods.

95,Protection of the Authentication Process in Banking Information Systems,95,"Lukova-Chuiko N., Bielonozhko A."," Abstract. Today, technology is evolving at an incredible rate. As a result, life has changed significantly over the last 20 years. Today, it is impossible to imagine a day without the Internet and the use of gadgets that make life much easier. All important things people can do without leaving home, just a few clicks.Since all information about our lives are stored online the delinquents have the opportunity to obtain personal data and use them at its discretion: steal identity, take out a loan to another person, steal money from a bank account, re-register property and more. Keywords: authentication, two-factor authentication, identification, unauthorized access, one-time password, information safety, safety, security The incredible advantages of making online payments can be listed for a long time, but you must also keep in mind the disadvantages. Throughout history, there have been people who wanted to earn in dishonest ways, and today is no exception. Now you can rob a bank without leaving home, for this you only need to find out the login and password of the bank's client and transfer money from his account. That is why it is so important for online banking to take the most reliable measures possible to ensure the reliability of data storage. A mobile application or web page requires a login and password to authenticate the user to ensure the integrity of customer data. In fact, when considering authentication, it should be noted that it is at this stage that most breaches of privacy occur, as the main purpose of thieves is access to the user's personal account. Accordingly, banks, for their part, must provide the maximum level of security when entering the user's personal account. Ensuring reliability at the entrance is achieved in different ways. When a user logs in, first of all it is authenticated. If the entered login and password match those stored in the system on the server, the user successfully logs in, otherwise he is denied access. $ authentication = new Authentication (); // Create an authentication model. $ authentication- ›setPseudo (""pseudo""); // Set a couple login / password. $ authentication- ›setPass (""pass""); $ authentication- ›setACcessToken (""accessToken""); //or use an access token. For a more reliable procedure of entering the personal account during the authentication stage, aids are used, such as captcha, confirmation calls, one-time passwords in SMS. It is these tools that help prevent intruders and protect customer data. In this period, the most reliable, easiest to implement and the most user-friendly tool are one-time passwords using SMS confirmation. Many online banking platforms use this tool to safely use the resources of their customers. One-time passwords are used to confirm transactions on the Internet, such as in a remote banking system. In the banking industry, the most common way to provide a one-time password is an SMS message that the bank sends to a customer who conducts a transaction in the Internet banking system. If you do not enter a password or enter an incorrect password, you will not be able to log in or send payment. This service is almost always provided by the bank automatically. One-time passwords work as follows: when the bank sets actions with the client's finances or when entering the personal account, the previously specified user number receives an SMS message indicating a one-time password, which is limited to a certain number of seconds. The user must enter the password sent to him within the specified time. // Create the API provider. $ provider = new ApiProvider (new Authentication ()); // Set a couple login / password. $ provider-> getAuthentication () -> setPseudo (""pseudo""); $ provider-> getAuthentication () -> setPass (""pass""); // or use an access token. // $ provider-> getAuthentication () -> setAccessToken (""accessToken""); // Create a Sending SMS $ message model. = new SendingSMSMessageRequest (); $ model $ model-> setMessage (""message""); $ model-> addNumber (""33600000001""); $ model-> addNumber (""33600000002""); // *** // Call the API and get t he response. $ response = $ provider-> sendingSMSMessage ($ model); // Handle the response. $ response-> getcode (); $ response-> getDescription (); $ response-> getSmsID (); *************************************************** // Create the API provider. Sprovider = new ApiProvider (new Authentication ()); // Set a couple login / password. $ provider-> getAuthentication () -> setPseudo (""pseudo""); $ provider-> getAuthentication () -> setPass (""pass""); // or use an access token. // $ provider-> getAuthentication () -> setAccessToken (""accessToken""); // Create a Sending unicode SMS model. $ model = new SendingUnicodeSMSRequest (); Smodel-> setMessage (""message""); $ model-> addNumber (""33600000001""); Smodel-> addNumero (""33600000e02""); // Call the API and get the response. $ response $ provider-> sendingUnicodeSMS ($ model); // Handle the response. $ response-> getCode (); Sresponse-> getDescription (); $ response-> getSmsID (); This practice prevents the declassification of the user's password or its selection by using a mechanical method. One-time passwords can provide complete protection for the authentication mechanism when logging in from replay attacks. This is a one-hundred-percent means of protection, because the way to change the password each time prevents both the ability to see the password and pick up the search method. The time required to select passwords by brute force is too long, and at this time a new password is already generated and all efforts will be in vain. Undoubtedly, this method makes it impossible to provide thieves with private information and is very effective. When using Internet banking when sending SMS messages directly to the user, the chance of intrusion into the authentication procedure and unauthorized access (unauthorized access) to customer information is reduced. This message ensures that you can log in from any device only if you have a customer's phone, which greatly reduces the ability to enter the office from different devices without the user's knowledge. Also an additional measure of protection is often to use a time timer for a one- time password, i.e. give a limited number of minutes to enter the generated sequence of characters that were used as a one-time password. The ability to receive one-time passwords via SMS is objectively rational, at least because it is as accessible as possible to a wide range of users and does not require special skills to use. The user only needs to open the received text and copy the sent password for input. In terms of usage, this procedure is maximally customer oriented. Considering the issue of information transfer in this context, the only drawback is the issue of the price side, because to send SMS messages requires funds. The method of protection of one-time passwords by means of SMS messages is very progressive and relevant for today. It is safe to say that even the cost of sending an SMS is worth the security of each user's personal data.

96,Impact of the COVID-19 on Social Engineering in Ukraine,98,"Lukova-Chuiko N., Prokopenko A."," Abstract. The COVID-19 pandemic made a big impact on social engineering all over the world. The goal of study in the paper is to make an analysis of how the sphere of social engineering is being changed with the pandemic. Keywords: COVID-19, phishing, social engineering, malware. The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the biggest problems of our time. The disease has severe consequences and the worst of them is death. Because of this COVID-19 is being used in a variety of malicious campaigns including email spam, malware, ransomware, and malicious domains. Fear is the main weapon in this case. It is aggravated by the stressful situation due to the strengthening of quarantine measures in Ukraine, fear for life and health (both his own and relatives), distrust of statistics on the number of patients and deaths from COVID-19 disease, various types of COVID-19 strains, confusion about the quality, availability and side effects of vaccination against this disease etc. So, people are ready to believe in anything to protect themselves from a real or potential threat. And that is immediately used by criminals. [1] As of October 2021, the number of vaccinated people is increasing and the number of deaths is decreasing [2]. However the number of social engineering attacks is not decreasing, but only changing the vector. Now the main theme for criminals is vaccination. Group-IB [3] is a global threat hunting and adversary-centric cyber intelligence company that specializes in investigating and preventing hi-tech cybercrimes. It has released a comprehensive analysis of fraud schemes on a global scale. In total, fraud accounts for 73% of all online attacks: 56% are scams (deceit resulting in the victim voluntary revealing sensitive data) and 17% are phishing attacks (bank card details theft). By using patented Digital Risk Protection (DRP) technologies, Group-IB experts detected over 70 scam groups employed only in one of the fraudulent schemes, Classiscam, 36 of which target Europe. It was established that in one year Classiscam threat actors alone swindled users out of €7,750,000. According to Group-IB analysis, the number of phishing attacks has more than doubled during the pandemic. Phishing is used to steal personal data and install malware. Hackers disguise their mailings to the addresses of reputable organizations: for example, the WHO, tax services, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention or Ministry of Health in case of Ukraine. Phishing attacks from the fake Ministry of Health on the topic of vaccination were recorded by the National Coordination Center for Cyber Security under the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine [4]. This phishing attack was aimed at Ukrainian Internet users, the main topic of which was the beginning of vaccination against COVID-19 in Ukraine. During the attack a fake web page was created on a popular hosting platform that mimicked the website of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. To place the page, the attackers registered several domains that resembled the official domain of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine - moz.gov.ua. This fake page contains information about the start of the mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 on January 25 with a proposal to download a file (Word document) with details. This document has built-in malicious code which downloads and executes another malicious script that provides remote control of the infected computer. In this way, the attackers gained full access to the victim's computer. ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) 2020 report [5] published by the European Union Cyber Security Agency (ENISA) highlights key aspects and trends related to the threat landscape: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of fake websites for online shopping and fraudulent online sellers increased. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases of cyberbullying and extortion has also increased. Attackers use social media platforms to increase the effectiveness of targeted attacks, and financial rewards are still the main motivation for most cyberattacks. The number of phishing victims in the EU continues to rise when criminals use the COVID-19 theme to lure ""customers"". COVID-19 thematic attacks include messages that contain malicious file attachments and messages that contain malicious links that redirect users to phishing sites or malware. Many cases of cybersecurity still go unnoticed or are detected for a long time. The number of potential threats in the virtual or physical environment continues to expand as a new phase of digital transformation emerges. We see that pandemic has a negative impact on people. It is caused by different reasons but the consequences are the same - the number of attacks has increased. In order not to get phished people should not open unknown links, not download files from unknown senders and check all the information they get by mail. Using these simple rules can prevent a person from becoming a victim of social engineering.

97,Using Agile Tools to Development the Project of Creating a “My City” Mobile Application,100,"Matolinets T., Kolesnikova K."," Annotation. The abstract is devoted to the issues of using Agile tools in the development of a mobile application for the ""My City"" project. The structuring of internal development processes has been done. The use of the Scranban hybrid framework is substantiated as the best tool for developing a mobile application. Keywords: mobile application, communal service, software development project, Agile, ScrumBan The most important subsystem of the city's economy is housing and communal services. At the present stage of socio-economic development of Ukrainian cities, the reform of housing and communal services as a system of life support of the city, is aimed at creating an effective management mechanism, attracting investment and reducing costs for services. Due to the low level of regulation and control, housing and communal services have almost no incentives for high-quality housing and communal services, productivity growth, introduction of new technologies, management, investments in modernization and reconstruction of facilities and engineering networks. Housing and communal services of cities are characterized by low investment attractiveness and require large investments for modernization and development. Housing reform should ensure its technological and managerial modernization, long- term investment, increase the potential for effective forms of management. In economically developed countries, housing management is provided through project management tools and is based on information technology, methods of continuous improvement of environmental management, stakeholders and value for the formation of models and effective management mechanisms. Among the tools that can speed up these processes, one of the main ones may be the development of a mobile application that will provide communal services with up- to-date information on emergencies and existing problems. This, in turn, will help communal services to solve the problems of the city and communities faster and better. The capabilities of modern gadgets and the availability of the Internet are forcing the market for smartphone applications to grow rapidly. Already in 2015, statistics showed that 14% of Internet users use only phones or tablets to access the World Wide Web. The pandemic has had a huge impact not only on millions of people, but also on the global economy and business processes. The mobile application industry has also changed - the balance of power in this highly competitive market has shifted. The processes that are taking place now will determine its development for decades to come. COVID-19 has led to a phenomenal growth in the mobile application market. Mobile phones now account for more than half of the time (50.1%) that people aged 16-64 spend online. Back in 2016, this share was only 33%. Now people use mobile applications in almost all walks of life [1]. Today, mobile applications are becoming more widespread, which allows solving community problems. However, although analogues were created in Ukraine, they were not developed with sufficient quality and therefore did not gain popularity. The research shows that the project of developing a mobile application “My City” for the management of public communal services has a fairly high assessment of experts and little risk for implementation. Emphasis will be placed on the communication of communal services with society. This will allow you to quickly and effectively eliminate existing problems in the field of housing. Today, mobile applications are becoming more widespread, which allow to solve community problems. However, although analogues were created in Ukraine, they were not developed with sufficient quality and therefore did not gain popularity. A detailed description of the problem will help communal services to respond quickly to problems and solve them with maximum efficiency. The use of modern software development will save man-hours in the performance of work and improve logistics. With the help of the “My City” mobile application, anyone will be able to register a problem or emergency situation and send information to the utility service. Also, the user will be able to check the progress of the work. Upon acceptance of the application, the communal service will have complete information about the problem, its location, photo and video information. The developed project can be implemented in companies that are directly involved in the development of special software. It should be an organization that uses modern software development tools, has well-established business processes and highly qualified staff. It is desirable that the company's order book has already implemented projects of national importance. Also, to implement the project it is necessary to have a team of development specialists who will be able to implement the project on time and in accordance with the budget. Based on the specifics of the project, you can choose the ScrumBan framework for its implementation. ScrumBan is a state-of-the-art hybrid method that uses Kanban's continuous workflow along with the useful elements of Scrum, and solves the problems of both approaches. This tool allows you to control the time frame of project tasks and quickly adapt to change. Table 1 shows the application of the ScrumBan framework in the project. Table 1 Application of the hybrid ScrumВan method Application of Scrumban in the process of mobile application development described on Fig.1. Figure 1 – Application of Scrumban in the working process (according to [2]) Scrumban uses a cyclical development process and continuous product improvement. This approach allows you to analyze previous work and improve them, if necessary. Applying this approach also helps reduce the risks associated with product sales. ScrumBan has its own implementation model for each team. The general Scrumban model will be used to implement the “My City” project. Under this model, the development team will use a waterfall software development model [3]. This approach will help to structure the internal development processes and clearly separate the iterations of functional development: planning; development; retrospective; release. Each of the iterations will minimize the risks over time, and each participant will be able to see a clear picture of following the plan. The sprint will last no more than 2 weeks: 1 week - active development of tasks; Week 2 - Testing and bug fixes. The above approach will help solve the problem of testing, as well as give developers time to fix bugs. Frequent releases will allow stakeholders to see all the activities of the project and progress in its course. As a result, users will be able to get exactly the functionality they need. A daily stand-up was introduced to track the daily progress of the tasks. At this meeting, developers and project participants talk about changes in tasks and problems. Tasks must be presented in the form of User Stories [4]. Any changes must be reflected in the control and visualization system (Jira or Trello). These software products [5] help to track the progress in the implementation of tasks, provide an opportunity to obtain statistics on the work of the team, set priorities for tasks, fill in the backlog and keep records.

98,Description of the Stages of Examination a Dependence Between Criminal's Appearance and Their Offense With Convolutional Neural Network,104,"Mudra A., Mezentseva O."," Annotation. The main purpose of this paper is to describe a solution method of investigation dependence between person’s offense and their facial features. During the description, firstly, is shown how the process was divided into stages, then, detailed each of them based on the experience of previous researches. Keywords: convolutional neural network, Criminal’s facial features, Offense People with their embedded instincts can process nonverbal information about other people and make right conclusions about their personality with some accuracy. Sometimes to figure out information about person’s character is significant, for example in cases when a person is inclined to do illegal actions. As noticed in previous study, the purpose is to discover associations between the features of criminal’s facial image and type of their offence. The process of examination is organized in five phases: data extracting, customize feature detector, developing convolutional neural network, draw conclusions and prepared them in a visualized format. The first step is a database formation. The database has to contain information about crime and photo of person who committed it. All the data divides into 2 datasets: train (90%) and test (10%). A testing dataset is required to make conclusions about accuracy of the results. An initial data extracts from website of Interpol from “Red Notices” category with a website parser. Next, it is needed to extract faces from pictures and normalize them [1]. As the facial recognition exist for some time, there are some ready solutions for this stage. Usually, a mechanism of aligner is also a neural network. It takes a picture that was taken from a camera, detects all the faces on it which it can find, ""cuts"" and ""align"" them. The third step is developing a convolutional neural network for examination dependence between facial images and crimes. The task of this investigation is pretty similar to a task of facial recognition. Facial recognition became very popular last years because of using in security systems, law enforcement apps and commercial use. That is why in this area experts use a lot of technologies, but the most useful is convolutional neural networks [2]. It can be explained by one remarkable benefit of CNN – ability to extract features, the most valuable information, pretty accurate. After data is processed we have an accuracy of the experiment that confirms or deny dependency between criminal’s appearance and their offense. Then, if dependency is confirmed, we can work with results. The fourth step is making conclusions based on the previous stage. The result has the following view: for every offense there is a set of facial characters, which are inherent for this particular act. The last step is to make result of the examination more visual. For this cases every set of characteristics can be presented as artificial image of person, that is a potential criminal for particular offense. Conclusions. After analyzing already existed concepts, that are used for image recognition and working with faces, a work plan was developed according to the best practices. For better concentration on the main task - scientific research, it was decided to customize almost all other processes, except the development of the main mechanism for the investigation of facial features and its interpretation. The development can be useful in different areas of life, but the main emphasis is on psychology, since the basic task is to explore the features of the psyche that can be described by the face. In the future examination can be repeated with a bigger amount of labeled data. Also research can be improved by examination not the whole appearance of criminals, but the particular features, which are responsible for the Big Five personality traits according to [3].

99,Biometric Identification in Mobile Operating Systems,106,"Myrutenko L., Nasyrova L."," Abstract. At the moment, the issue of information security is becoming increasingly important in society. Reliable storage and protection of information is currently relevant not only for businesses to maintain trade secrets, but also for ordinary users. Theft of confidential information, for example, to gain access to bank accounts, personal messages or other materials that can be used for malicious purposes and disrupt the financial or psychological state of its owner, is becoming more widespread every year. Keywords: identification, two-factor authentication, biometric authentication, password, confidentiality, information security. In order to ensure reliable protection of confidential user data, various means of information protection are used. Comparative analysis shows that the most reliable information access systems that do not use a regular password, which consists of letters, numbers and symbols, are biometric information access control systems. At present, such systems are increasingly used in banks, firms, information departments of firms, and so on. In recent years, it has become apparent that biometric technology is most effective in the application of methods of identification and control of access to information. These findings are explained by the fact that biometric security features have a high reliability of identification and are becoming increasingly accessible to ordinary users. Biometric identification is the identification of a person by unique, unique to their biological characteristics. In the modern world, such systems of biometric information protection are used as: checking the shape of the hand, fingerprints, retina or iris, model or photo of the face, the dynamics of the signature or voice. Such information security systems are used on their own before the data used in them cannot be lost by the owner, stolen or copied. Biometrics has continued the inevitable migration from desktop to mobile devices. Both the mobile and biometric industries continue to strive for smaller and more powerful devices. The last few years have seen the accelerated introduction of biometric data on mobile devices. More recently, iris biometrics have been added to Samsung devices as a logical extension of their current fingerprint support. Several biometric hardware devices have been introduced to the market, and size and computing power have increased with each generation. With the introduction of Cross Match SEEK, SEEK Avenger and Verifier Sentry, the size of these devices has decreased. A new set of Android processors and small, low-power fingerprint devices has allowed Amrel, Credence and Northrup Grumman to enter the market and compete directly with traditional Intel-based systems. With the help of the Qt platform, an application has been developed for storing user passwords, which is protected by biometric means, which will be installed and used in the Android mobile operating system. Qt is a platform for developing applications between platforms for desktop, embedded and mobile. Supported platforms include Linux, OS X, Windows, VxWorks, QNX, Android, iOS, BlackBerry, Sailfish OS and others. Qt is not a stand-alone programming language. This is a frame written in C ++. The preprocessor, MOC (Meta-Object Compiler), is used to extend the C ++ language with features such as signals and slots. Before the compilation step, the MOC analyzes the source files written in C ++, extended Qt, and generates standard C ++ sources from them. Thus, the framework itself and the programs / libraries that use it can be compiled by any standard C ++ compiler, such as Clang, GCC, ICC, MinGW, and MSVC. Implementation of biometric authentication in the developed application: Connecting C ++ and QML Library for biometric authentication (e.g. Touch ID): QLocalAuthenticator authenticator; authenticator.setReason(“Acces your private information!”); authenticator.setPolicy(QLocalAuthenticator::PolicyWithBiometricsOrPa ssword); connect(&authenticator,&QLocalAuthenticator::authenticationFinished ,&myFancyClass, &MyFancyClass:: authenticationFinished); Creating the LocalAuthenticator class: void MyFancyClass::authenticationFinished(bool success, QLocalAuthenticator::AuthenticationFailureReason reason) { if (success) qWarning(“Authentication was successful!”); else qWarning(“Authentication failed! Reason = %d”, reason); Connecting QML module: import fsee23.authenticator 0.1 Using the LocalAuthenticator class and connecting it to a UI object: LocalAuthenticator { id: authenticator reason: “Get access to your private information!” policy: LocalAuthenticator.PolicyWithBiometricsOrPassword onAuthenticationFinished: { if (success) console.log(“Authentication was successful!”); else console.log(“Authentication failed! Reason = “ + reason) } } Considering the processes of authorization, authentication, verification and research of biometric means of protection of confidential information, we can conclude that the biometric protection system has a high level of reliability, compared to conventional passwords or PIN codes. This is because biometric protections focus on who a person is, not what he or she knows. It is difficult to forge this method of authentication, because some biometric security tools collect information that is unique to an individual user, such as the most popular - a fingerprint or face model.

100,Methods to Increase the Effectiveness of Protection of External Media From Unauthorized Access and Modification,109,"Nakonechnyy V., Zakharchenko Ye."," Abstract. Today, Internet technologies are evolving faster and faster. We use social networks to communicate and transfer a lot of information. More and more data is transmitted via the Internet. There are more and more hacking methods, so there is a high probability of unauthorized use of personal data, information for the benefit of the attacker. There are also more and more viruses and spyware that can be secretly installed on computers, collect and modify data, and use your device's resources. Thus, the issue of transmission and storage of information is one of the most important issues of human security and personal data. Keywords: External storage media, virtual disk, confidential information, access distribution, invisibility Attackers can connect to a mobile device and steal personal data through the Internet resources or/and social network. One phone left without a password gives an attacker the opportunity to make a purchase for a significant amount, format all data, including from the cloud storage and even destroy a person's social life. Transmission and storage of information requires detailed consideration and finding a reliable way to implement it. It is better to use external media to transmit confidential information than the Internet or cloud storage. Since, access to the second one does not involve direct access to the system. This can be done from anywhere with Wi-Fi, mobile or any other wireless network. There are currently many types of external media. The most popular are floppy disks, CDs, hard drives, memory cards, and flash drives. Some of them are outdated, have relatively little memory today, or are simply out of date. Today, USB flash drives, hard drives, and memory cards are used to store and transfer data. However, they all have their advantages and disadvantages. Memory cards are too small. To use them on a computer, you should use special card readers - card readers. In addition, they are easy to lose. External hard drives, with large amounts of memory for stored information, are not easy to physically carry. Their dimensions and weight are too large to constantly move from one place to another. Flash media is probably the most appropriate option for everyday use. It can store many documents. Nowadays, USB drives can contain terabytes of information. Most personal computers support this format. There are various data protection tools on USB drives. One of the main steps to protect information is using encryption [1]. Passwords are set to ensure accessibility. Binding to information about the user / serial number of the components of his computer is often used. To protect against copying, most often used methods are: recording information in unused sectors and checking the location and content of ""failed"" sectors. These methods are practically useless due to the possibility of taking the full copy from the device using the appropriate application software [2]. The basic idea of external media security in this work is to divide the memory into two parts. One of them will be hidden for the user and for the system. A comparison of key files on both parts of memory will be used to access the hidden storage. That is, in a closed area there is a sample key, which must be identical to a specific file on an open disk. For example, we can have a folder – “RIZNE”. To open a closed part, a similar folder with the same content must be created. The great advantage of this is the extremely large variability of the key. It can be a file of any format with a variety of content. This can be a text document or an image or any program file [3]. When it used on third-party devices, it will be a normal flash drive, without the attributes of a protected flash drive. That is, the average user will not even have a clue about the hidden information. Even with its loss and full formatting, the closed area remains intact and inaccessible. If your password is lost, it`s possible to use computer serial number information checks or somethink like that. Thus, the use of the proposed method of data protection on external mobile media will provide the basic properties of information: confidentiality, integrity and accessibility.

101,Analysis of Potential Vulnerabilities in IoT Systems,111,"Nicheporuk Anast., Nicheporuk Andr., Savenko B., Kashtalian A., Oppong I."," Abstract. The fourth industrial revolution put on new rails processes of automation in industry, healthcare, home and other areas of human life through the mass integration of the concept of the Internet of Things into these areas. However, this concept leaves a number of potential bottlenecks in the security of such systems for attackers. Third-party access to data collected by smart devices in, for example, a smart home can lead to a variety of emergencies, the degree of danger of which will depend solely on the will of the owner of the intercepted data. In this paper we had analyzed the treats based on the fundamental principles of IoT systems: the interdependence, interconnectedness, and constant communication of IoT devices. Keywords: IoT, Threats, vulnerabilities, Cyberattacks, Network Traffic Introduction The growing popularity of IoT (or ""Internet of Things"") provides large opportunities to improve, plan and automate our lives. IoT allows you to network and manage multiple devices that provide data collection, analysis and transmission. The scope of IoT continues to expand every year, covering new areas of life, from smart homes, cities to healthcare. However, along with the obvious benefits and conveniences of using IoT, the concept of the Internet of Things leaves a number of potential security bottlenecks for attackers. Personal data collected by IoT devices is always of value to hackers and thieves of confidential information. In addition, a cyberattack on an IoT solution has the potential to damage physical services and physical infrastructure. For example, hackers successfully attacked a Jeep Cherokee while driving on the highway under the driver's control. Therefore, timely detection and resolution of such vulnerabilities are priority areas in the development of the entire IoT industry. Vulnerabilities and attacks on IoT networks From year to year, the attackers try to compromise and stole the private information by hacking the local and corporate networks. From the point of view of IoT networks, the specifics of their work reveal even more vulnerabilities and existing bottlenecks for attacks in contrast with ""conventional"" network. The most important reasons why criminals choose to attack IoT devices, in particular smart homes, are their constant availability on the Internet, limited computing capabilities, which makes it impossible to install security systems directly on the devices themselves, vulnerabilities related to authorization / authentication devices on the network, heterogeneity of the devices and their communication environment, vulnerabilities in web interfaces, lack of proper attention from end users (""put and forget"", which often manifests itself in leaving standard logins and passwords, lack of checking for updates, etc.). The combination of these factors leads to considerable interest among criminals who are trying to implement more and more cyber-attacks. Any device connected to the network can be potentially vulnerable [1-3]. An attacker can attack any part of the IoT information system, including physical devices (collection of confidential information, attack on capturing nodes), network services (DoS, jummong-attacks), cloud services (SQL injection, SYN-flood), web applications (viruses, ransomware attacks) and vulnerabilities that are unique to IoT systems. Although IoT devices mimic the concept of client-server architecture that underlies LANs, there are a number of vulnerabilities that are unique to IoT systems. Such vulnerabilities are based on the fundamental principles of IoT systems: the interdependence, interconnectedness, and constant communication of IoT devices. Consider them in more detail. Threats related by an interdependent IoT environment With the rapid increase in the number of objects implemented in the IoT system, communication between them has become increasingly automated and tends to reduce human intervention. IoT devices no longer simply interact with each other like conventional devices on a network. Currently, many IoT devices are designed from the standpoint of smart city vision, so that many of these devices are controlled by other devices or depend on the internal state of other devices or the environment. For example, if the GPS sensor is aware of the traffic situation on the way from the user's home to work and the user's known health condition (e.g. asthma), then the GPS should choose the route that best suits his health condition (less traffic and pollution). atmospheric air) based on health data and motion sensors and air pollution. Another example that illustrates the vulnerability of IoT due to the interdependence of the environment is the situation in which a window is opened in the event that the room temperature is elevated and the air cooler is turned off. Such interdependent processes are common in applications that use IoT devices to achieve a fully automated process. In this environment, the target IoT device may not be available to the attacker, but the attacker may change the mode of operation of another device or its parameter through an environment that has a direct interdependence to activate the threat. Therefore, an attack on one place, such as lowering the temperature or manipulating contamination data, can have serious consequences for other sensors, whose operations depend on the information of these sensors. In such an interdependent environment, an attacker can select the weakest links in the system to disrupt the entire system. Threats related by an interconnected IoT environment At the present stage of technology development, millions of devices can be connected to IoT systems. With these highly connected devices, an infected Internet item can become a destructive tool of attack that can infect many things on a large scale, thus affecting the entire system (such as a smart city). The work [2] show that IoT devices, even with secure standard cryptographic methods, can be used by attackers to create a new security risk category that can be spread from a single IoT device to all physically connected devices over an IoT connection. Thus, an attacker can launch rapid and destructive attacks, which can be difficult to control. To illustrate the impact of this scenario, an experimental study was conducted in which the spread of infection was simulated using Philips Hue smart lamps, which can be one of the components of a smart city. Malicious software was distributed by moving directly from one lamp to an adjacent lamp via a ZigBee wireless connection. Researchers [2] have found that the AES-CCM global key can be used to encrypt and authenticate a new firmware without knowing the actual smart lamp updates. This situation shows how vulnerable such devices are, even if they use strong cryptographic security methods. Such attacks can start at one point, and can end up infecting the entire city system, thus allowing attackers to control city lights or use IoT lamps in DDoS attacks [2]. Thus, it can be stated that the interconnected environment opens wide opportunities for the rapid spread of threats in IoT systems. Threats caused by tracking the nature of changes in network traffic Analysis of traffic metadata sent from IoT devices can provide information about the habits and lifestyle of the owner. According to a study [3], an attacker who uses network traffic interception can use passive network monitoring methods to collect metadata that IoT devices exchange with remote control servers. Even if traffic from IoT devices is encrypted or transmitted through a VPN tunnel, an attacker has the ability to identify the device owner by using DNS queries and device MAC addresses [4-5]. Another method of identification is to determine the intensity of network traffic, ie the frequency of repeated requests to remote control servers and the first six digits of the MAC address, which are a unique identifier. To implement such a scenario, an attacker must have access to the victim's local network, because MAC addresses are not available for traffic at the ISP level. To simulate the scenario of obtaining metadata from network traffic, the authors reviewed four popular smart home devices, including a Hello Sense alarm clock and sleep controller, a video surveillance camera, a Belkin WeMo switch, and an Amazon Echo speaker. The study found that the attacker was able to determine the time when the owner of the device was at home, which is manifested in bursts of activity from devices such as Amazon Echo and Wi-Fi switches. In addition, the researchers were also able to determine when the owner was asleep. At this time, there was increased activity on the part of Sense Sleep Monitor. The device became more active when it had to collect and send data about the user's activity during sleep. The activity of CCTV cameras Nest can determine when the owner leaves the house. The cameras were activated only when a person left the house and turned on the video surveillance system, which manifested itself in sending pictures from the cameras to a remote with a certain interval. The analysis showed that the success of such attacks is due to the principle of IoT-devices and the need for a permanent Internet connection. Concusion Thus, developers of IoT systems very often take to the background the issue of security of IoT devices, thus giving attackers a wide range of possible attacks on a particular network infrastructure. Given that IoT systems follow the concept of client- server architecture that underlies LANs, many vulnerabilities are common to both LANs and IoT systems. However, there are a number of vulnerabilities that are unique to IoT systems: interdependence, interconnectedness, and constant communication between IoT devices. Therefore, the development of new approaches to improve the security of IoT-systems is an important promising area.

102,Usage of N-grams for Predictive Search,115,"Paliienko M., Latysheva T."," Abstract. The subject of this publication is predictive search. We reviewed the advantages of using n-grams and edge n-grams. Also, we reviewed how fuzziness can be introduced using cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity. The relevance of this work is associated with utilization of predictive search for user queries in many use cases. Keywords: Predictive search, token, n-gram, edge n-gram, fuzziness, cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity. Autocompletion of queries is widely used nowadays. In can be observed while looking up a question in a search engine, typing a name of a place in a taxi app, or a name of a product on a marketplace platform. Predictive search helps users to type less to find what they needed. Most commonly predictive search is implemented using n- grams. N-grams N-gram is a sequence of tokens, such as words or characters. For example, the word “fuchsia” can be broken down into next n-grams: ’f’, ‘u’, ’c’, ‘h’, ‘s’, ‘i’, ‘a’. Such n- grams made of one unit are called unigrams. N-grams containing two and three units are called bigrams and trigrams respectively. Table 1. N-gram tokenization by variations Similarly, we can break down a sentence into n-grams containing words. The sentence ‘clair de lune ’has the following unigrams: ‘clair’, ‘de’, ‘lune’. N-grams are useful in cases where user’s queries can represent any part of a text they are looking for: song lyrics, part of a news title, etc. Edge N-grams There are cases where we expect that the user won’t start a query from any part: name of a city, product, etc. Edge n-grams will be more beneficial than n-grams here. Edge n-gram is also represented as a sequence of tokens, but unlike regular n-grams, they are built from the beginning of a given word or sentence. So for the word “fuchsia”, the following n-grams would be produced: ‘f’, ‘fu’, ‘fuc’, ‘fuch’, ‘fuchs’, ‘fuchsi’, ‘fuchsia’. Despite edge n-grams consume more space, results are more precise in the cases they are used for. Fuzziness Users often make mistakes in their queries. N-grams can be efficiently used for fuzzy matching. There are multiple approaches that apply for n-grams. Count matches In this options matching n-grams of query and a candidate are counted. For example, state of Pennsylvania and its misspelled variant “Pensilvania” have eight common bigrams: ‘Pe’, ‘en’, ’ns’, ‘lv’, ‘va’, ‘an’, ‘ni’, ‘ia’. Cosine similarity N-gram sequences can be converted to vectors to calculate cosine similarity. It is defined by the cosine of the angle between two vectors. The lower the distance, the more words are similar. For example, words “ubiquitous” and “ubiquous” have a distance of approximately 0.24.𝐴 ⋅ 𝐵 =∥ 𝐴 ∥∥ 𝐵 ∥ 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑐𝑐 Jaccard similarity N-gram sequences can be converted to sets to calculate Jaccard similarity. It is defined by the ratio of size of the intersection over size of the union of two sets. This ratio equals to 0.6 for words“ happiness” and “happyness”. Words are likely to be similar if the ratio is high. 𝐽(𝐴, 𝐵) = |𝐴∩𝐵| |𝐴∪𝐵| Implementation N-gram and Edge N-gram tokenizers example of an implementation is given in Python code. def ngram_tokenizer(token, ngram_length): ngrams = [] for i in range(len(token) + 1 - ngram_length): ngrams.append(token[i:i+ngram_length]) return ngrams def edge_ngram_tokenizer(token): ngrams = [] for i in range(len(token)): ngrams.append(token[:i+1]) return ngrams 2021.

103,Cisco Network Resources Protection Using Python Language Specifics,117,"Parkhomenko I., Ozhereliev S."," Abstract. The rapid increase of amount of data today has led to constant threats to information security. Increasing computing power has made it possible to connect many devices to the Internet. Due to the fact that it is rapidly gaining momentum, all areas of business are prone to face numerous vulnerability issues. The need to protect against threats to systems and sensitive data is constantly growing. Cybersecurity is the combination of software and hardware with organizational activities, and if organizational activities may not change over the years, software and hardware are constantly being upgraded. Keywords: information security, network security, cyber security, network administration, cisco, data confidentiality, cyber security software. Python as a cybersecurity tool For several years, Python has been the dominant language in cybersecurity. This is a server-side scripting language, so the resulting script does not need to be compiled by encoders. This language is general purpose and is more commonly used in cybersecurity than others. Python integrates many security tools. Python scripts can help easily automate and search for files and ports, especially when analyzing malware. [1] However, not all Python experience is the same in security. To create an effective portfolio, develop effective software, and properly demonstrate your value, you need to focus on using the right Python libraries and frameworks for the industry. Python provides two levels of access to network services. At a low level, you can access basic socket support in the base operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and offline protocols. Python also has libraries that provide higher-level access to certain application-level network protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, and more. Many Cisco network devices come with a built-in Python interpreter that you can use to run scripts and programs directly on them. In addition to the interpreter, Python libraries are included, which provide direct access to operations with devices to execute CLI commands or monitor events. Python libraries for network security CLI Python Module is a Python module that allows users to interact with Cisco IOS using the CLI. Cisco IOS (Internetwork Operating System) is software used in Cisco switches and network routers. The code example below shows how to import the CLI library and execute some standard Cisco commands. #!/usr/bin/python import cli #library import print cli.execute('show version') #system version check cli.configure('ip route 10.0.0.129 255.255.255.255 10.80.1.55') #static routing setup This allows you to run any command to verify or configure the device. Netmiko is an open source Python library that simplifies the management of SSH network devices. It is a common and easy-to-use library that supports network devices with multiple providers. Network automation is primarily about collecting results from display commands and making configuration changes. [2] Netmiko installation command: pip install netmiko The dictionary that defines the parameters of the device: cisco_router = { 'device_type': 'Router1', 'host': '192.168.0.1', 'username': 'user', 'password': 'cisco', 'secret': 'secret' } Examples of commands for working with the device: ssh = ConnectHandler(**cisco_router) ssh.enable() ssh.exit_enable_mode() Netmiko sending commands methods send_command – send one command Example: result = ssh.send_command('show ip int br') #show ip interface brief send_config_set – send one or several commands in configure terminal Example: commands = ['router ospf 1', 'network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0', 'network 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 area 1'] result = ssh.send_config_set(commands) send_config_from_file – send command from file (uses method send_config_set) Example: result = ssh.send_config_from_file('config_ospf.txt') send_command_timing - send a command and wait for the output based on the timer The following is a full-featured Python script that demonstrates how to automatically configure a device with a single file: import netmiko from netmiko import ConnectHandler iosv_l2 = { 'device_type': 'cisco_ios', 'ip': '192.168.1.50', 'username': 'cisco', 'password': 'cisco', 'secret': 'cisco' } net_connect = ConnectHandler(**iosv_l2) net_connect.enable() output = net_connect.send_command('show ip int brief') print(output) config_commands = [ 'int loop 0', 'ip add 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.0', 'no sh'] output = net_connect.send_config_set(config_commands) print (output) output = net_connect.send_command('show ip int brief') print (output) The script connects to the device via SSH with the specified login data, displays brief information about the interfaces of the device, configures the address of one interface and includes it. Then again displays information about the interfaces to obtain fresh data. Measures to strengthen cybersecurity have become extremely mandatory with the increasing severity of cyber attacks and technological progress. As an inventive language, Python has become extremely useful in the field of information security, as it supports and performs many cybersecurity functions, such as malware analysis, scanning and intrusion testing. In addition, the flexibility and simplicity of the language have made it possible to interpret online tools from a leading Cisco vendor. With Python, you can implement a large pool of applications for tasks such as malware detection, scanning and analysis of cyber threats, automation of penetration tests, hardware configuration, security checks of programs, systems, and more. Python has a large number of libraries and frameworks for the cybersecurity, the use of which in appropriate combinations creates good conditions for the implementation of software protection of information systems.

A structure and applications on the smart dust network are performed. Keywords: sensors, sensor networks, smart dust. Nowadays IoT and IoE take great part in all spheres of human activities [1].

105,Research of Detection Methods of Steganography Applying in Cyberattacks and Spying Software,122,"Piskovyi P., Laptev O."," Annotation. The dynamics of the use of steganographic methods during the development of malware and cyberattacks is analyzed. The analysis identified the reasons for the frequent use of steganographic methods in cyberattacks, as well as the effectiveness for attackers. Some methods of finding filled stegocontainers were investigated, and the effectiveness of each was determined in a particular situation. Keywords: message, key, stegochannel, stegosystem, container (stegocontainer). Introduction. The problem of reliable protection of information from unauthorized access is one of the oldest and not yet solved problems. Computer steganography is one of the effective methods of information protection. Computer steganography is the hiding of a message or file in another message or file. For example, stegоnographers can hide an audio or video file in another informational or even large graphic file. Currently, computer steganography continues to develop. A theoretical base is being formed and new stable methods of message embedding are being developed. The main reasons for the growing interest in steganography are restrictions in some countries on the use of strong cryptography, as well as the problem of copyright protection for works of art in digital global networks [1]. Computer steganography is widely used in the exchange of secret messages, the development of virus software, copyright protection, data hiding from copying, etc. It has gained popularity among both malware creators and cyber-attacks [2]. Therefore, the problem of studying the methods and methodology of steganography is an urgent scientific task. Steganography identification methods. The use of steganography was noticed in the following malware and cyber espionage methods: Microcin (AKA six little monkeys), NetTraveler, Zberp. Enfal (its new loadercalled Zero.T), Shamoon, KinS, ZeusVM. Triton (Fibbit) [3]. After analysis, we can identify three main reasons for the active use of steganography by malware authors: it allows them to hide the fact of uploading the data, not just the pieces of data itself; it helps to bypass DPI-systems, which is relevant in corporate networks; steganography allows bypassing the test in AntiAPT-products, because such systems can not process all graphic files (there are too much of them in corporate networks, and analysis algorithms are quite expensive). There are several statistical methods of data analysis for the content hidden in them steganographic methods of various kinds of information. Consider a few of them. The histogram method of statistical analysis is also known as the ""chi-squared"" method. Raster is being fully analyzed, each color is quantified by the number of dots of this color in the raster (to make it simple, we are talking about an image that has one color plane). The method is based on the assumption that the number of dots of two adjacent colors (""adjacent"" colors stand for colors that differ by the least significant bit only) differs significantly for a normal, regular image (empty container) and the number of pixels of such colors is approximately the same for a filled container. Based on that, for zones that have the quantified value of the chi-square less than the threshold, we can accept the initial hypothesis ""the frequency distribution of adjacent colors is the same, therefore, it is a filled stegocontainer."" If you look at the image for a visual attack, you can easily identify that these areas contain the embedded message. Thus, the method works for embedded messages with high entropy. Another method is called the RS method, where RS means ""regular-singular"". All images are divided into many pixel groups, then a special flipping procedure is used for each group. Based on the value of the discriminant function before and after the application of flipping, all groups are divided into regular, singular and unused. The algorithm is based on the assumption that the number of regular and singular groups of pixels in the original image and in the image after the flipping should be almost equal. If the number of such groups changes significantly during the application of flipping, it means that the investigated image is a filled container. Acknowledgements. The results of tests on the correctness of the mentioned methods have shown that in images with low entropy ""chi-squared"" attack can not be used - the results are either unsatisfactory or not quite accurate. Thus, RS-attack has worked perfectly: in both cases the hidden message was identified. But what if automatic analysis methods showed the absence of the embedded message, but we still suspect its presence? Specific procedures can be used to obtain the payload, designed for specific families of malware. More and more malware developers start to use steganography to hide software communication with the command center and to download various modules. This brings effective results, as the procedures for containers analyzing are quite expensive. Mostly, defensive solutions are not able to handle every object that could potentially be a filled container. However, there are solutions, that are based on a combination of different methods of analysis, high-speed predicates, the metadata investigation of a potentially filled container, etc. A number of methods for finding filled stegocontainers were investigated, and the effectiveness for using each of them in a given situation was determined.

Logistics gives an opportunity for optimal process management in the transportation, storage and handling of any items. An important part of the goods delivery to the consumer and maintaining its original condition is provided by warehouse logistics. Automation of warehousing processes will be provided by the implementation of the information system Pick by Voice, which will effectively manage the stages of goods receiving, sending and searching. As a result of the project, we will have 3 products [1]: an implemented system for warehouse management by voice, which allows voice control, a system that provides communication with the operator and an information site with the necessary information about the system. Consider the products in more detail: An implemented system for warehouse management by voice. The warehouse operator has a specific device with which he can give commands and receive voice answers regarding the receipt, dispatch, inspection or searching of goods in the warehouse. The device has a specific screen, that displays data, speaker and microphone. The system is built in such a way as to recognize the operator's commands and perform certain actions with goods. The system (program) that provides communication with the operator is used to connect Pick by Voice technology and the operator. It contains several screens that are displayed on the device (screen for entering the serial number of the product, quantity and other characteristics). This program is developed individually for each client. Information site. The structure of the site is divided into the following main sections: Full product description System description and instructions for use Section where you can order the purchase of the system implementation Promotions and offers Updates Among the project main tasks list that need to be solved to achieve the goals, we can note the following: providing the necessary machinery and equipment, development of a system prototype, development of technology implementation, launch of system implementation, development and implementation of product processing functions, website creation, providing high-speed communication of the system with the operator, organization of interaction with stakeholders and promotion of the system, providing the opportunity to purchase the implementation of the system and supporting information about the use of the system. This project solves not so much a need or problem as the ability to facilitate the process of receiving, sending and searching for goods by developing a convenient interface. The implementation of the system will allow you to synchronize information between your own customer systems and Pick by Voice. From a constructive point of view, the project life cycle can consist of eight standard phases (project definition, project organization, quality management, team building, project planning, execution management, project tracking, project completion. In the first phase the main tasks are defined: conversation with the project initiator; office market research; analysis of the competitive environment; analysis of available information; passport preparation; creation of the project charter. The economic model is of great importance in the project, where costs and revenues are analyzed [2]. Also net capital, loan disbursements, income and cash flow are investigated. It is worth noting that this section determines the sales of the product, taking into account the price and projected volumes. The implementation of a voice-controlled system will create a new need for potential customers, provide a platform for integration with various programs and applications, create new ideas for the development of warehousing logistics in the future. The analysis [3] shows that each warehouse system requires process automation, which will allow to manage all product functions quickly, smoothly and efficiently. Therefore, the implementation of the Pick by Voice system will create additional opportunities in warehousing logistics management. Therefore this implementation will be useful for customers with different product monitoring systems, because Pick by Voice has a data integration function, which allows you to get all the detailed information about the available items in the warehouse.

107,Theoretical Bound of The Complexity of Some,126,"Semenov V., Denysov S."," ALGORITHMS FOR VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES Abstract: This work is devoted to the study of three new extragradient type algorithms for solving monotone variational inequalities in a Banach space. A complexity bound are proved in terms of the gap function for variational inequalities with monotone Lipschitz continuous operators acting in a 2-uniformly convex and uniformly smooth Banach space. Keywords: variational inequality, extragradient algorithms, gap function, complexity, 2-uniformly convex Banach space, uniformly smooth Banach space. Areas of operations research, data analysis, and mathematical physics produces many problems, which can be written in the form of variational inequalities. With the growing popularity of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other adversarial learning models, a steady interest in algorithms for solving variational inequalities has arisen among specialists in the field of machine learning. This report is devoted to the study of three new extragradient type algorithms for solving monotone variational inequalities in a Banach space. The first two algorithms are natural modifications of Tseng method [1, 2] and “Extrapolation from the Past” method [3] for problems in Banach spaces using the generalized Albert projection [4]. Iteration of each of these algorithms is more economical than iteration of the extragradient method, because the first one uses single projection on iteration, and the second one needs only one operator calculation. The third algorithm, called operator extrapolation method, is a variant of the forward-reflected-backward algorithm, proposed by Malitsky and Tam [5]. Operator extrapolation method also uses generalized Albert projection onto the feasible set. An attractive feature of the algorithm is only one computation at the iterative step of the operator value and the generalized projection. Let us describe the studied algorithms for variational inequality find x C : Ax, y  x  0 y C , where C  E is a convex and closed set, A : E  E* is a monotone and Lipschitz continuous operator.

108,The Analysis of the Approach to the Remote Implementation of the Information Systems Into the Project-Oriented Organizations,128,"Skorobahatko K., Myrchenko A., Khlevna Iu."," Abstract. The article addresses the challenges associated with the remote implementation of information technologies. The article contains an analysis of existing approaches to the organization of remote software implementation, recommendations for improving the implementation of information systems for remote project management, and prospects in terms of methodological, organizational, and technical components. A model of the remote software implementation project is proposed. Keywords: implementation, methodologies, information technologies, remote work, management. The trends in the development of information technologies are aimed at the transition to the digital transformation and integration of all the aspects of project- oriented enterprises. In essence, it means that all management processes are completely transferred to the digital environment. This is a requirement of today's realities. At the same time, the transition to a new dimension, which is associated with remote work, leads to challenges for the implementation of information systems (IS) in the practice of project-oriented enterprises. Since the transition to online work was established not so long ago, approaches to the management of the remote implementation of information technologies are not yet fully formed and require more detailed studies. The implementation of information systems into the practice of enterprises can be characterized by a period of change when the enterprise moves from its usual management methods to a new level. About 70% of all enterprise change initiatives fail. Most of these failures are caused by hasty changes, hasty implementation of management information systems when managers delve into lots of initiatives. In the work [1], an approach to the implementation of corporate project management systems (CCMS) within development companies and their project portfolios is outlined. But the works do not address the issue of conditions for remote implementation, the impact of remote tools on the success of the project. This issue is partially covered in the paper [6], which presents the factors that negatively affect remote work, in particular the problems that can be influenced by the project manager for a more efficient organization of work. Continuation of the idea of communication management to achieve effective work is described in [8]. The focus of the work is the importance of organizing data, roles, keeping the necessary documentation online, and using common platforms for management. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the use of certain approaches and tools to ensure communication and interaction of participants in the online process is formed in [2]. But there is no instrumental component in these works. This problem is addressed in [5]. The article describes the effectiveness of using software that helps to remotely plan and manage project implementation. The description of the tools is presented in more detail in the works [3, 4], in particular, attention is paid to the tools that can be used during the organization of remote software implementation. Namely, S. Jain's book describes an approach to automating the entire process of software installation and maintenance, which will significantly reduce time and human effort. The work of A. K. Kichigina reveals the features of remote installation of operating systems in the modern world. Thus, the remote implementation of information systems into the work of project-oriented enterprises should be considered in terms of the project. In particular, there is a problem of combining existing organizational, methodological tools in project management with the means of remote work. The result of this combination is the development of a project model for remote IS implementation. Traditionally, project management is a specialized organizational structure - the project management office, which concentrates the functions of professional support of project management processes in the organization. The authors propose the creation of a separate department for remote implementation of IS, in which the labor resources are: manager, methodologist, IT groups, which are divided into three: software development team; software implementation team; software support team. The first one is responsible for the development of the information system, which will be implemented in the future. The development team controls the quality of the developed software and its compatibility with the client system. The second one deals directly with the remote implementation: installation and configuration of the software. The specialists of this group are involved in the project for a limited time and ensure the functionality and stability of the implemented system on remote devices. The third group, in turn, deals with customer issues and solves problems that arise after the implementation of the software. Such a team should be in touch with customers around the clock, responsibilities include analyzing problems and providing ready-made solutions. Each team has its own manager who coordinates its actions. At the same time, in terms of the organizational component, it is appropriate to highlight the interaction of stakeholders - the communicative component. The communicative component aim is to determine the completeness, reliability, and efficiency of information exchange between those involved in the project on the remote implementation of IS. To implement this component, the following principles are identified: accessibility; simplicity; logging of information exchange; systematization; the ability to quickly find the information you need and provide it at the right time. Establishing communication within the team is implemented by creating communication channels according to the specifics of the work. Particular attention should be paid to video conferencing and trying to make most of the interaction in video format. As there may be difficulties with hardware or software during the remote work, it is necessary to involve additional staff to organize the effective work of all team members, in particular, to set up remote communication channels and be responsible for data security. In addition, these staff should monitor the provision of appropriate conditions for the remote deployment of all team members. Specific technologies should be discussed in advance to assure customers of the safety of the selected tools. Using the example of the selected organizational structure and established roles, the next stage for remote software implementation is appropriate to choose a methodology of work. It is proposed to use a concretized project management methodology [8]. Before starting a remote deployment, you need to check the availability of the necessary software on your own and the client's side for remote interaction. Next, the technical expert should be able to remotely connect to the client-server, download and configure the software. After that, you will need to make sure that the software was installed without errors and can be launched without problems on the client-side without the help of a technical expert. Upon completion, it is necessary to inform the team and clients about the success and remind them of the communication channel with the support team in case of problems. It is recommended to use the following principles to successfully manage this component: using only secure communication channels; using CAD / CAM / CAE, CAPP, and PDM systems; selection or development of information technologies that would satisfy the use of methodological documentation templates. In the process of organizing the implementation of a project, you should not neglect special information technologies. As with classic project management, it is worth implementing the Microsoft Project platform or similar to identify problems and attract staff and implementation partners to complete their tasks. It is recommended that you set up a project management software or Kanban board that contains specific tasks for carrying out projects to implement systems. Conclusions. The main problem of the organization of remote control is revealed. After analyzing the available work and research in the direction of organizing the remote implementation of information systems, it was found that they are now presented in insufficient quantities. There is a very small number of works where approaches to the remote implementation of information technologies are studied. The analysis of the triad: organizational - methodological - technical component in the project of remote implementation of information systems is presented. Highlighted the principles that contribute to the implementation of the project for the remote implementation of information technologies.

109,Solving Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations by Cramer’s Rule and Excel Table Processor,132,"Soroka P., Gamotska S., Vlasenko O."," Solving many practical problems requires finding solutions of systems of linear algebraic equations. But it is often difficult to find the exact solution of such systems manually. To do this, the developers of the Excel table processor offer a function to calculate the determinants used in the Cramer’s rule. Consider in more detail the implementation of this method of solving a system of linear algebraic equations using an Excel table processor. Suppose we have a system of linear algebraic equations A x = b, (1) where  a11  a21 a12 a22 ... ... a1n  a2n , A =  ...  a ... a ... ... ...   a (2)  n1 n 2  b1   x1  nn  b   x  b =  2  , x = 2 . (3) ...  ...  b   x   n   n  System (1) has a unique solution when the determinant detA =A |≠ 0. To solve such a system of linear algebraic equations, we use Cramer's rule: If detA =Δ ≠ 0, i.e., the matrix A has an inverse A-1, then system (1) has a unique solution xi =Δi /Δ, i=1, 2, ..., n, where Δi is the determinant obtained from the determinant Δ by replacing the i-th column with a column of free members b (3). It should also be noted that for completeness of the analysis, except for the case considered above (detA = Δ = | A | ≠ 0), when the system (1) has a unique solution, consider the case detA = Δ = | A | = 0. For this case, system (1) has many solutions when all Δi = 0, i = 1, 2, ..., n, and system (1) is incompatible, i.e. there are no solutions when at least one of Δi ≠ 0, i = 1, 2, ..., n. To implement the Cramer’s rule and the cases described in the previous paragraph, the Excel table processor (Russian version) should use the function to calculate the determinant МОПРЕД(MDETERM). For more information, you can use the help for this function. We show how the solution of systems of linear algebraic equations is realized using the Cramer’s rule and the cases described below by examples, i.e. we solve the following systems of equations: The solution of the system of equations (4) will look like this For system (5) we have The sequence of solving the system of equations (6) will look like this Thus, thanks to the Excel table processor, systems of linear algebraic equations (4), (5) and (6) are easily and visually solved. To check the solutions of system (4) we use formula (1). Next, select the range of cells AJ2:AJ4, enter the formula =MУМНОЖ(C2:E4;AG2:AG4) (MMULT) and press Ctrl–Shift–Enter. As you can see, the values of the cells of the selected range coincide with the values of the vector of free members b of system (4).

110,Analytics of Automated Systems in the Context of Personnel Management,134,"Stelmakh V., Kobevka N., Khlevnyi A."," Working with staff is an important and time-consuming part of any business. Effective personnel management is critical not only for the company [1], but also for interaction with regulatory authorities. Personnel management systems have many components. This includes the management of internal and external motivation, the use of methods of material incentives or sanctions, payment of wages, maintenance of discipline, determining the level of responsibility for each employee, and maintaining appropriate documentation [2]. Staff rotation and inefficient personnel management can negatively affect a company's efficiency. Currently, there is a trend towards significant changes in the field of personnel management by automating HR-processes [3]. Among the reasons: reloading of applications, significant time spent on approving the requirements for candidates during the recruitment process, a large number of information flows, the human factor during the analysis, which leads to errors in reports, inefficiently organized adaptation program for employees, as a result of which a new team member has a discrepancy between the actual and the expected, misunderstanding of the requirements and incorrect judgment about the purpose of the company. The result of one of the studies conducted by Deloitte was the conclusion that by implementing an automated system, the company can save more than 20% of costs per employee [4]. In the HR-department you can automate a range of business processes aimed at recruitment and staff development: hiring, onboarding, payroll, accounting, performance appraisal, tracking the resumes of potential applicants, the formation of personnel reserves, compensation payments and bonuses, data analysis and employee reporting. There is already a wide range of systems aimed at organizing the work of the personnel management department. Such systems provide an opportunity to staff the employees so that a long-term development strategy is built, the creation of a personnel reserve, a hierarchy of succession among managers, the ability to direct staff to achieve production goals, ensure optimal accounting in HR, plan and control the process of staff training so that it meets business objectives [2]. In addition, modern developments make it possible to integrate HR management systems with cloud services, which potentially increases efficiency, reduces the time for the organization of interaction between data, and allows you to automatically process certain information [5]. Automated systems also have functionality that helps analyze and visualize large amounts of data for further forecasting and decision making. Automation requires resources on the part of HR staff, because it is not the transfer of all paper documents in electronic form, it is a complete change of existing processes, their clear formalization, structuring and standardization. It is also customary to implement enterprise automation projects as a project portfolio, so that there is a clear connection between them, which will help to move smoothly from recruitment to onboarding, then to learning and goal management, and so on. However, if you pay attention to the prospects of the company in the case of organized management of human experience, the cost of implementation pays off over time by reducing the number of employees for the HR department in the future, automation increases employee loyalty to the company and reduces staff turnover. It is in turn saves the cost of recruitment and onboarding of employees, provides the opportunity to transfer knowledge. Nowadays, there are many systems that can simplify and improve HR performance, some of which can provide quality management for only one process, such as recruitment, while others may include multiple modules and qualitatively cover the requirements for multiple processes. The task of this work is to analyze existing systems and identify factors of system selection for the HR department. SAP SuccessFactors is an automated talent management system. This system consists of modules that cover all aspects of work in HR. Any module can be used as a separate solution [6]. The system consists of modules that can be implemented in turn as needed. These modules work in synergy when implemented, i.e. it is possible to use additional functions. Also, a feature of this system is the onboarding to customer requirements, i.e. the implementation team can modify the templates in order to improve the customer experience. It is a cloud solution that allows you to work from any device with access to the Internet through any browser and mobile application. A distinctive feature is the availability of a secure HR-portal for new employees undergoing onboarding. That is, users at the stage of onboarding get acquainted with the system, which conducts all personnel operations, goal setting and daily tasks. The use of this system implements efficiency on a scale, i.e. the larger the company - the greater the savings from the use of this product. Hurma System is a program for optimizing the routine work of the HR department. One of the disadvantages of the system is the limited functionality, compared to SAP SuccessFactors. This system does not cover all the needs of HR employees, as there are no document reconciliation processes, which would allow a greater transition to electronic document management and speed up decision-making processes [3]. PeopleForce is a modular online platform for personnel management. The cost of use depends on the number of employees and modules that will be implemented at the enterprise. It is proposed to take into account the following factors when choosing an automated system for the HR department: the number of employees in the company, the budget for the implementation project and the annual subscription costs, the reliability of data confidentiality. Today, there are many solutions, platforms to simplify the work of HR-managers, but you must first form the basic requirements for the system and only then look for programs that will meet the needs [7]. Conclusion The systems discussed in the article have an intuitive interface that provides a good user experience. Each of the systems provides reporting and analytics to enable strategic decisions based on these documents. The SAP SuccessFactors solutions positions flexibility, as it contains a very large number of tools that can be adapted to the needs of the customer company. Automation requires resources on the part of HR staff, because it is not the transfer of all paper documents in electronic form, it is a complete change of existing processes, their clear formalization, structuring and standardization. The following powerful tools for automation and optimization of talent management processes were considered in the article: SAP SuccessFactors, Hurma, PeopleForce. Companies are looking for innovative solutions that will significantly reduce the burden on the human resources department.

The relevance of building a high-quality customer profiling process and sales forecasting using recurrent neural networks using the LSTM-method is considered. The limitations in the process of using forecasting methods and the limitations of recurrent methods are described. Recommendations for eliminating the restrictions are given. A brief description of the LSTM-method operation process is given. Keywords: Supply Chains, forecasting, Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTM. Introduction. The functioning of supply chains is a complex multicriteria task, at the head of which is the prediction of customer buying behavior [1]. Once the forecast is built, organizations make plans to provide production with the necessary resources and define supply chains. Given the probabilistic nature of each of the processes, and especially sales, there is a threat of accumulation of forecast errors. The main task for management is to ensure high-quality profiling of clients and the construction of predictive models [2]. The complexity of the forecasting problem grows with the increase in the product range and the expansion of the product parameters. As a result, the forecast comes down not only to determining the number of future sales, but also predicting consumer preferences within the product range and identifying patterns of consumer behavior. The relevance of the introduction of new methods. A dynamic environment subject to rapid scientific and technological progress and globalization of markets does not allow obtaining a high-quality solution using traditional methods of forecasting and classification. One of the ways to solve this problem is to use new types of neurons, for example, recurrent neural networks [3]. This type of networks has by the presence of a number of significant disadvantages: the disappearance or off-scale gradients in the learning process. When a problem of the first kind occurs, gradient approaches zero at an exponential rate, which makes it impossible to study long-term events [4]. A problem of the second kind is characterized by the presence of a rapid increase in the value of the gradient, and the algorithm “goes off scale” and stops. To solve this problem, it is possible to use one of four methods: changing the number of layers (it is recommended to reduce it); control of the rate of change of the gradient and artificial limitation of the rate of its change; control and adjustment of weights; use of LSTM-methods. Experience has shown that using LSTMs is effective for learning complex patterns without having to design functions. Applications using the LSTM method can handle large networks (from 100,000 to millions). Parallel computing and graphics processing units (GPUs) are recommended to keep training times realistic. Overview LSTM-method. The LSTM-method uses LSTM memory blocks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) [5]. The content of the memory cell is modeled by the input gate and the forgetting gate. If both gates are closed, then the content information remains unchanged when moving from the previous time step to the next. The gate structure makes it possible to store information over several time slices. This ensures that gradients work overtime, which compares favorably with other traditional algorithms. Figure 6: Simplified diagram of a recurrent network As can be seen in Figure 1, the block output is recursively connected to its inputs by all block gates, where sigmoid activation functions are used in the range of values [0,1]. The network uses three types of gates, among which three functions are clearly distributed: input - protects the block from events below threshold values; forget gate - clears the memory buffer; output - transfers the memory value at the block output. To update the weights in LSTM networks, the supervised learning method is used. For this, one vector is fed to the input of the algorithm, which later become activators of the input blocks. All blocks calculate the parameters of their current state, the value of which is a non-linear function, at each time step. The vector error can be calculated as the sum of the deviations of the activator value from the regulatory values. All outputs from hidden layers of neurons are transmitted with a one-time delay at each step. The signal is transmitted to all neurons in the hidden layer. Summary. Changes to the traditional approach to forecasting sales and subsequent planning of purchases can significantly improve the quality of forecasts. his will have a positive effect on the result of the functioning of supply chains. The use of the LSTM method allows us to bring the quality of forecasts to a new level, but at the same time a full-fledged implementation of the application is available and expedient only for large companies. This is due to the requirement for a large amount of data to train the model.

112,Development and Features of Project Management to Create an Interactive Map for Solving Ecological Problems and Air Pollution,139,"Tatsienko O., Morozov V."," Unfortunately, the field of monitoring emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere in our country is extremely poorly developed. Nevertheless, the problem of lack of software and hardware to meet these goals, on the contrary, is quite acute. Consider the main problems in this area. First of all, the unsatisfactory condition and increase of pollutant emissions into the air is due to the obsolescence of equipment to prevent emissions into the atmosphere from the territories of large enterprises with high emissions of harmful substances. At the same time, at some enterprises, apparently such equipment either does not work at all according to the current requirements, or is completely absent. Therefore, we see the second problem - the presence of a corruption component that helps unscrupulous dealers to evade the sanctions of the responsible audit authorities. The third reason is the large number of personal vehicles in the population, which, in the process of their work also contribute a large share to the total amount of emitted harmful substances. The third problem is complicated by the fourth - improper and outdated road planning, especially the local road space, which leads to frequent and long traffic jams during ""rush hour"", which force large numbers of cars to work even longer, thereby increasing emissions. The proposed project is an Internet service - an interactive map that will show the level of air pollution in Ukraine, information that will be displayed on the interactive map in the future, is collected from statistical sites that monitor relevant indicators and have open ARI. This approach, in particular, ensures the transparency of the data presented and complicates the impact on them for stakeholders (unscrupulous managers of pollutants (large enterprises), or corrupt officials (officials of relevant state supervisory authorities)). In addition to the map, on the given graphic materials, we can observe the possibilities of the platform for expressing data in the form of various graphs, which serves to facilitate the perception of the information obtained. The developed Internet service, being an interactive map, provides fast and stable access of each interested user to data on air pollution. The solution of the form of the interface ""interactive map"" has shown its relevance and convenience around the world in connection with the epidemic COVID-19, this is the form of reporting the number of diseases in some areas used by many countries. This type of interface is much clearer than a list, even a TOP list, which allows a wide range of people to receive and work with information: from ordinary people to journalists and officials, not environmental experts. This leads to an increase in the likelihood of positive changes: in addition to raising awareness of the official responsible for this area, it facilitates reasonable public pressure on such an official (public protests, media coverage, concern about the state of affairs of the responsible official). A simple form of displaying information can serve the direct purposes of education, due to low requirements for recipients, it can be used in particular in interactive lessons in schools, which will positively serve the development of responsibility and environment-oriented consciousness in future generations of Ukrainian youth. In addition, the Internet service allows you to obtain information much faster than by direct analysis of relevant Internet resources, which has a positive effect on the efficiency and quality of the final data received by the user. The importance of the project is illustrated by two sources of sociological data: a nationwide survey ""Environmental protection in the public opinion of Ukrainians"" of the Foundation for Democratic Initiatives. Ilka Kucheriva from October 26, 2021 and the press release of one of the sections of the all-Ukrainian public opinion poll of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology from May 2018. Respondents from all regions of Ukraine took part in both surveys, except for the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts at the age of 18. The number of respondents in the first survey was 2001 people, in the second - 2025, so we can say about the representativeness of the views expressed.

113,Lead Nurturing Implementation Project Management to Optimize Marketing Communications in the B2B Segment,141,"Titova M., Morozov V."," Building communication in the B2B segment is very different from B2C. First, there is a much longer decision cycle and user path. Relationships with customers need to be built for the future: through relevant and timely content to fuel interest in the product, to form loyalty and the image of an expert in the field. It is also much more difficult to segment the audience and clearly target its message [1]. In the case of B2B, it is advisable to segment by professional interests and level of interest in the company's products and services. Given the above features of this segment, the optimal strategy is to use the technique of Lead nurturing. First, such a communication strategy fully meets the needs of companies in the B2B segment, makes their communication as effective as possible, helps to automate the process through the use of CRM system. At the same time, domestic companies, in contrast to foreign counterparts, are not yet very active in its use, and therefore it will provide the project a difference from others and a significant competitive advantage [2]. The fact is that ""ice growing"" involves the creation of a large number of diverse expert content and considerable time, while the lion's share of entrepreneurs, not understanding the features of B2B, want to see results here and now. Secondly, it allows to make the project relevant, in line with the latest trends in online communication. Lead nurturing is the process of interacting with potential customers, which is to create relevant content in order to conclude a deal in the future. This technique involves the transition from mass communication to mass personalization, ie allows the brand to talk not about themselves but about customer problems. Its effectiveness is proven by Forrester Research, whose study showed that organizations that use effective Lead Nurturing programs generate 50% more ""ready to buy"" potential customers, while reducing costs by 33%. At the same time, according to the Annuitas Group, grown ice buys 47% more than usual [3]. This strategy involves working with all relevant platforms and creating relevant content for them. The choice of platform and content depends on the professional interests of the CA and the willingness to enter into an agreement. To determine this readiness, it is appropriate to use ice-scoring technology [4]. This is a method of crushing the lead base by assigning them certain points, according to predefined criteria that show how ready the customer is to enter into a deal. In short - this is a way to segment ice into hot and cold. The task of any sales manager is to identify such ""hot"" customers and give them maximum attention. We can see the dependence of the need for a certain type of content on the sales funnel stage in Ben Hunt's ""Stairs of Recognition"" model [5]. It is also advisable to use banner advertising with a unique sales offer that may interest a potential buyer to go to the site. Such banners should be placed on those information resources, where there are often representatives of CA. It is important to note that due to the large number of advertisements on the Internet, users are paying less and less attention to it, the so-called ""banner blindness"" has appeared. It can be overcome only with the help of non-standard solutions that the user does not expect to see. The chosen strategy allows you to start communicating with a representative of the CA, even when he does not have a clearly defined task to purchase a particular type of product, but this topic is generally interesting to him. At this stage, we offer him content on topics related to his professional interests and place it both on our own website and social media pages, and on information resources as guest publications or expert materials [6]. There are thematic blogs, forums, conferences, etc. in any field of activity. You need to partner with these people or companies. Create content for them and get traffic. In addition, you can and should organize webinars, online conferences and panel discussions.

114,Cryptography Module Solution for ACS,143,"Toliupa S., Bielozorova O."," Abstract. In recent years E-commerce gained a exceptional growth due to its assets. Even though benefits of E-commerce are considerable, it creates some security hazards such as debit, credit card fraud, phishing etc. In this paper we introduce a system that provides an unrivalled security using quantum cryptography. Visual cryptography [1] hides the details of customer by generating shares whereas quantum cryptography secures the transmission of one-time password. Keywords: Cryptography, 3D-Secure, transactions, ACS. Paying attention to the current payment security threads, next conditions must be met in any of the modern payment systems [2]: Confidentiality. Customer data, such as credit card number, should be known only to the relevant organizations involved in the payment process. Preservation of the integrity of the information. Information about the purchase and transaction data must be protected from unauthorized changes. Authorization. Both parties should be confident that they are dealing with exactly the person it claims to be. Checks the authenticated user of the transaction (e.g. solvency). Wide range of means of payment. The buyer may pay any transaction available funds. Guarantee risks. The seller must have a warranty from the many risks associated with the use of the payment system. Minimization of the payment transaction. Payment order processing, obviously, will be included in the cost of operation and should be minimized. Payment must be paid even in the case when the buyer refuses to accept the purchased goods. Most payment systems act as a security guarantee by demanding their participants of using 3D-secure technology [3] in which user`s authentication takes place at card issuer`s access control server (ACS) [4]. The ACS contains the authentication rules and is controlled by the Issuer. ACS functions include [5]: Verifying whether a card number is eligible for 3-D Secure authentication Verifying whether a Consumer Device type is eligible for 3-D Secure authentication Authenticating the Cardholder or confirming account information While these functions may belong to a single logical ACS, implementations may divide the processing by function or other characteristics among multiple physical servers. For the App-based protocol, the direct link between the 3DS SDK and the ACS is only established if the transaction requires a challenge. It is initiated by the 3DS SDK using the URL provided to it in the ARes and established using a TLS protocol with ACS (server) authentication by the 3DS SDK [6]. Protocol—TLS Internet ACS public key—commercial. Certificate format: commercial CA signing ACS key—commercial The challenge and Cardholder response data is encrypted and MACed using the session keys previously established between the ACS and the 3DS SDK. Protocol—secure channel. If the CRes message contains a URL(s) directing the 3DS SDK to fetch data from an external server, an additional link is established using a TLS protocol [7], with server authentication by the 3DS SDK [8] based on a commercial server certificate. Proposed payment system solves the problem that payment system is not secure since any eavesdropper can act as customer by hacking information submitted by customer [9]. The problem is solved by using two cryptographic techniques visual cryptography and quantum cryptography. In proposed method snapshot of text containing customer’s account number and debit and credit card information is taken. From the snapshot image two shares are generated using visual cryptography. one share will be in the hand of customer and other one will be in database of bank [10]. Merchant and customer agrees on a sessional key at the start of the payment. After that customer select the desired items and transfer blinded list of items with encrypted account number to bank. This blinded list is generated by encrypting list of items with sessional key between customer and merchant [11]. Figure 7 - Transactions in proposed payment system The proposed payment method provides considerable improvements on security than the existing approaches. In proposed method customer’s authentication details are hidden by using visual cryptography [12]. Embedding of one-time password in customer’s share prevents an eve from masquerading as customer by hacking share. Use of quantum cryptography secures the transmission of one-time password. Consider an eavesdropper has hacked the customer’s share embedded with one time password during transmission of share to bank [13]. Eavesdropper [14] can’t reuse this share for acting as customer since one-time password, which varies for each transmission is embedded in share. So, when an eavesdropper sends this hacked share to bank for transaction, validation of one-time password gets failed, and transaction gets rejected. Also, eavesdropper cannot be able to gain user authentication details from share because in order to gain information of customer from customer’s share both the customer’s share and bank’s share should be combined. Quantum cryptography used in proposed payment method prevents an eavesdropper from measuring and cloning the one-time password [15]. So, an eavesdropper cannot guess the function used for generating one time password. Thus, the proposed system guarantees unconditional security [16] using visual cryptography, quantum cryptography and image steganography [17]. In this paper E-payment method using quantum and visual cryptography and image steganography is proposed. The proposed system based on two cryptographic provides unconditional security by preventing man in the middle attack. Visual cryptography used in this system safeguards the customer’s data whereas quantum cryptography and image steganography prevents security threats such as phishing, identity theft. Proposed method for E-shopping can be extended for other bank applications.

115,Comparative Analysis of Well-known Security Scanners (with Nessus),147,"Toliupa S., Hetman V."," Abstract. For checking the security of information resources, specialists increasingly resort to tools such as a security scanner or even a full-fledged vulnerability management platform, which includes a security scanner, and integration with infrastructure, and integration with other systems. This article includes a list of such tools and their institutional comparison with each other (according to the main factors on vulnerability). Keywords: security, scanners, vulnerability, Nessus. Introduction. The presence of vulnerabilities in information systems, infrastructure nodes or components of the complex is not disputed as a big problem for information security systems. Of course, you can manually search for gaps, but it will be an extremely labor-intensive process that will take a lot of time with a high probability of missing something. The global vulnerability market itself is already quite scanned. These are system systems tools for managing vulnerabilities. Vulnerability tracing projects contain, in which representatives of various structures participate. Also, scanners perform integration with risk management systems or patch management, platforms for manufacturers of incidents, secure, without using the already mentioned SIEM. An urgent task of choosing a solution for managing vulnerabilities. This work contains statistics of testing various solutions and a conclusion why one or another scanner is suitable for its purposes. Base for statistics. The results of the comparison of network security scanners were obtained through penetration tests with nodes at the network perimeter. At the same time, the following were evaluated [1]: number of vulnerabilities found; false positives; false negatives; reasons for missing; completeness of the database of checks (in the context of this task); quality of inventory mechanisms and software version detection; the accuracy of the scanner (in the context of this task). The listed criteria together characterize the ""suitability"" of the scanner for solving the task assigned to it, in this case it is the automation of routine actions in the process of monitoring the security of the network perimeter. The scanners presented in Table 1 were selected to participate in the tests [2]. Table 1. Selected scanners Three PCs were selected as a network node within the same network and similar parameters. Second level heading. The first place according to all the criteria of this comparison (table 2) goes to the MaxPatrol scanner, the second place is taken by the Nessus scanner, the results of the other scanners are significantly lower. Table 2. The results of the tests In fact, there is nothing unexpected or surprising in the result obtained. It is no secret that the MaxPatrol and Nessus scanners are popular among security professionals [2]. Let's try to analyze the reasons for the clear leadership of MaxPatrol and Nessus Scanners, as well as the reasons for the ""loss"" of other scanners. First of all, it is a high-quality identification of services and applications. Inference-based checks are highly dependent on the accuracy of the information collection [3]. The second reason for their success is the completeness of the base and its adequacy to the task at hand and in general to ""today"". According to the results, it is noticeable that the base of checks in MaxPatrol and Nessus has been significantly expanded and detailed, it is ""put in order"", while the obvious ""bias"" towards web applications is compensated by the expansion of checks in other areas. The third reason is a qualitative analysis of application versions, taking into account operating systems, distributions and various ""branches"". You can also add and use different sources (vulnerability databases, notifications and ""vendor"" bulletins). Finally, we can add that MaxPatrol and Nessus have a very convenient and logical interface that reflects the main stages of the work of network security scanners. Disadvantages of Nessus. The main reason for the lag in Nessus is missing vulnerabilities, but not because of the lack of checks in the database, as in most other scanners, but because of the implementation specifics. Firstly (and this is the reason for a significant part of the omissions), there is a tendency in the Nessus scanner towards ""local"" or system checks, which involve connecting with an account [4]. Secondly, the Nessus scanner took into account fewer (in comparison with MaxPatrol) sources of information about vulnerabilities [5]. Conclusions. The work doesn't show that Tenable is necessarily much better than the rest of the products. It's just that in this context, this solution coped better than the rest. Tenable's products offer a wide range of capabilities to identify and effectively address many security threats in real time. Companies that are considering using vulnerability scanners in their infrastructure should decide on the required capabilities of the product (whether flexible configuration of the reporting subsystem is required or basic enough, whether continuous monitoring of the network or determination of behavior anomalies is needed, etc.), as well as the types and amount of information assets in the organization. Despite the large number of possibilities for security analysis, all the solutions presented lack built-in support for domestic standards, because the company recently entered the domestic market, which is partially offset by the ability to create its own reports.

116,The Potential Danger of Shodan Search Engine,150,"Toliupa S., Honcharenko N."," Annotation: Shodan has been called “the most dangerous search engine in the world”. That’s a pretty strong claim, but why would a search engine bring so much harm? Shodan has been around for just over ten years now, and the massive threat it was made to represent is yet to materialize. Still, that doesn’t mean it won’t be the source of various dangers. Keywords: Shodan, IoT, network, security, search engine, SCADA. Shodan is a search engine that indexes all the IoT (Internet of Things) devices on the Internet, making them easy to discover and access. Shodan indexation works by searching open ports of any service or device. This means that Shodan, unlike any normal search engine, does not focus on searching web pages but on collecting the banners of the services (server response to a request). These services include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, Telnet, SNMP and SIP protocols. Then, the user can search for devices by regions or geographic areas applying specific filters. Moreover, when Shodan performs a deeper search, it gives back results with information such as what type of device is connected to the Internet, where is located and who uses it [1]. Search results usually include cameras, web-connected medical devices, smart home hubs, and so on. That’s it. So why is it so “dangerous”? Shodan removes “security through obscurity”. Obviously, that the IoT security provided by confidentiality in most. If someone thinks their IoT device is safe just because it isn’t a website or crawled by Google, then Shodan removes that illusion [2]. ""When people don't see stuff on Google, they think no one can find it. That's not true."", said John Matherly, the creator of Shodan search engine [3]. There are numerous cases where IoT devices that aren’t secure are sold to consumers. For example, an IP-camera may not have a unique per-unit password. Since so many users don’t bother to change the default passwords on cameras and other similar devices, it means hackers can easily access these devices. With the explosion of vulnerabilities in smart devices inside homes, in our cars, and every business, lack of security is a recipe for disaster [2]. Shodan operates for 24 hours, during 7 days a week, and every month collects information about 500 million connected devices and services. However, there are much more sensitive and dangerous machines connected to the Internet than smart home devices: power station control systems, traffic lights, lab equipment, assembly lines, and many more. Even a smart garage door opener could pose a potential threat if taken over by an attacker. Things we can find with a simple search request in Shodan is stunning. Countless traffic lights, security cameras, home control systems and heating – all of them are connected to the Internet and all of them are easy to detect. We can access almost a half of the devices on the Internet using the default password. Thus, a quick search with ""password default"" filter finds thousands printers, servers and device management systems that use ""admin"" phrase as a login and ""1234"" as a password. In some cases, connected systems even do not require authorization at all – we just need a browser to connect to them. But why does such a number of IoT devices have no protection? The main trick is that many of these devices should not be online at all. Companies often buy systems that allow to control, for instance, the system of thermostats using a computer. How do they connect this computer to the heating system? Instead of connecting that directly, many IT-units simply connect both systems to the web server, opening it, for their negligence, to the rest of the world. And of course, there is no protection in such systems. These devices, first of all, should not belong to the Internet conceptually. Basically, Shodan tracks public access devices, preferably in SCADA systems (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition). SCADA systems are used to control and supervise industrial processes remotely in real time [1]. Shodan uses automated search tools which allow massive queries. One of these tools is Shodan Diggity. This tool is powered by a database known as Shodan Hacking Database that works as a kind of dictionary to locate different devices connected to the Internet: printers, webcams, routers, transit systems and, of course, industrial control systems [1]. Also with the help of Shodan the fuel station, wine refrigerator wine in the hotel, crematorium and, what is the most dangerous, the control systems of the nuclear power plant could be detected. Figure 1 – The web-panel of crematorium control system with full access due to credentials from Shodan If the machines that run our lives today are exposed to anyone who can type a search into Shodan, that’s a huge problem – traffic accidents, explosions, serious product defects, and any of a million things the imagination can conjure up. Think of the Stuxnet worm and how it was used to halt the Iranian nuclear program. Those systems weren’t connected to the Internet, which meant the malware had to be smuggled inside somehow. With Shodan, that won’t even be necessary [2]. It’s easy to point fingers at a tool like Shodan and blame it for being reckless. However, if the standard of security and privacy in the IoT industry was up to scratch, a tool like Shodan would be harmless. If the author of Shodan had not invented it, someone else would have. If a network of exposed IoT devices weren’t connected to the Internet, Shodan is neutered. Moreover, anyone who creates an engine like this doesn’t have to do it in an open, public-facing manner as Shodan has been done. It could be like those search engines hidden on the dark web, with anonymous authors. In the end, this is a case of shooting the messenger rather than listening to the message itself [2]. Unfortunately, Shodan still attractive to cybercriminals and hostile nations interested in activating a large-scale war similar to a cyber-Blitzkrieg. If Shodan is capable of tracking SCADA systems as we mentioned above, the national security of many countries could be compromised since an attack on their infrastructure is already possible [1]. But, in other hand, Shodan promotes the use of the search engine among medium and large companies. For instance, Shodan can help to do empirical market intelligence because it provides the information about those electronic products connected to the Internet that people use the most. Shodan is also useful to monitor the computers of your network with Internet access [1]. By the way, Shodan has a younger and even more dangerous successor – Censys. This search engine is able to find devices vulnerable for an APT [4]. As with new technologies such as smartphones, facial recognition, or social media, we need to figure out the rules and standards as we go. While there aren’t enforces minimum standards and regulations or industry alliances to that end, people are going to connect insecure IoT devices to the network [2]. The least we can expect from governments and large corporations who keep our data is to do it in proper way so that a tool like Shodan is useless against those measures. It doesn’t matter whether it’s the DMV or the Pentagon, IoT security has to be taken seriously [2]. When it comes to regular customers, there is such a thing as responsible IoT use. We can get started with setting of custom strong passwords on all smart devices. Also there is a huge need to secure the internal network, partially by using a VPN. It is worth buying devices from reputable brands that aren’t likely to have backdoors. Of course, Chinese no-name analogues could cost cheaper, but breaking them in – just a piece of cake. Generally, for appropriate protection of all IoT devices it would be highly useful to: set a complex password for the control panel of the smart home, as well as the home Wi-Fi network and the router itself; update software on smartphones, tablets and smart gadgets regularly; implement two-factor authentication where possible; use specialized controllers (for example, based on Raspberry PI) to control the smart home; configure the appropriate filtering in the region of the home network access; encrypt traffic inside home network. The list goes on, but the point is that we should never use IoT devices as simple plug-and-play machines. So, taking control of the privacy and security is a major key for safe use of IoT technologies.

117,How to Protect Your Card on the Internet,154,"Toliupa S., Lutsenko V."," Abstract. The security of online shopping is very important today. Thousands of online transactions occur every day, each of which could be a target for a hacker. The need to develop modern and effective solutions for protecting the data of plastic cards becomes obvious. Keywords: card, 3D Secure, visa, mastercard, browser, online, transaction, scammer, CVV2 Probably, there is not a single active Internet user who has never bought or paid for something online. And every time a person enters their bank card details, they are exposed to potential danger. [1]. Not only cardholders are interested in the security of Internet and browser transactions, but also banks, online stores and payment systems, which are developing ever new, more advanced and at the same time expensive methods of securing online payments and protecting against scammers. All participants in the transaction risk their money, and stores, banks and systems also risk their reputation. Oddly enough, in the terminology of payment systems there is no such thing as an Internet transaction. From the point of view of Visa and Mastercard, a transaction on the Internet is no different from a transaction in a terminal, by phone or IVR. Payment systems consider the Internet only as a transaction method. And this introduces some confusion when the owner of the card communicates with the bank that issued the card. Probably, many people who regularly use cards have come across a situation where the card seems to be open for payment on the Internet, but payments on some sites do not go through. The opposite situation is also possible, when the issuer does not indicate in the agreement for opening a card about the possibility of payment on the Internet, and payment on some sites can still go through [2]. At the bank that serves you, you must indicate the exact information for communication when paying for purchases with a bank card in online stores. For example, an email address is usually used to send payment confirmation, which you can later use to track your order. A mobile phone number is required in order to contact the client for order confirmation, or inform him of any difficulties, for example, flight cancellation or loss of goods. Please be aware that not all banks allow the use of certain types of cards, such as Visa Electron or Maestro, to pay for online purchases. This is all related to the types of transactions that are allowed on the bank side. The type of transaction depends on the parameters involved in authorization: CVV2, magnetic stripe, PIN, 3D Secure password, presence of a chip. As well as the type of terminal: traditional POS terminal, e-commerce, Mail Phone order, ATM. There is no such property that would indicate the environment of the transaction, in particular - the Internet. In view of the above, you need to always be careful with your salary, credit, business, corporate or any other card that has available funds. It is possible to recommend not to use these cards on the Internet, despite the convenience, where there is always an available amount, as a rule, many types of transactions are allowed. Also, do not show the card number and the reverse side of CVV2 in queues at the terminals and do not let the card out of sight, handing it over to the cashier, waiter or other staff. In some cases, the amount from the card can be debited even without entering CVV2. It will be enough for an attacker to spy on your card number and expiration date in order to make a payment on the Internet. Also, one of the means of protecting the card, now technical, is the 3D Secure protocol - the Visa Secure program for the Visa payment system and Mastercard SecureCode for the Mastercard [3]. Despite attempts to promote the 3D Secure protocol by payment systems, banks in Ukraine are in no hurry to implement it and continue to invent their own methods of protection against fraud. In short, 3D Secure is a protocol of Visa and Mastercard payment systems, which allows you to additionally authenticate the owner of the card by redirecting him during an online purchase to the website of the issuing bank. At the same time, the issuing bank checks the entered password and gives an answer about the consent or refusal to carry out the transaction. To summarize, how to warn yourself against the actions of fraudsters, after all, they still use simple rules, how not to infect a computer with viruses, how not to let a thief into an apartment, and there is nothing burdensome in observing the rules for using cards [2] do not reach the card in public places do not lose sight of the card when paying for goods and services use on the Internet only cards that are specially open for this purpose connect the card to the 3D Secure protocol do not transfer card data to a third person enter card details only on verified sites, preferably with the Visa Secure and Mastercard SecureCode logos set an individual Internet payment limit on the Internet card use antivirus use two-factor authentication during payments contact the bank security service at the slightest suspicion of theft of information or funds Visa and Mastercard payment systems establish uniform rules for handling claims, which usually protect the user and guarantee a refund in case of fraud, if there was no fact of compromise and transfer of data to a third party [4]. This may not always work in the current legislation, but this is a significant advantage over non-refundable local virtual payment systems.

118,Management of Creative Projects in Tourism,156,"Tsesliv O., Kolomiiets A."," Abstract. Tourism is one of the leading areas of Ukraine's economy, which provides budget revenues, creates jobs, develops a positive image of the state, increases the competitiveness of national tourism products, has a significant impact on Ukraine's economy. Today, a promising area is the use of creative tourism management technologies within Ukraine. Creativity has the most significant impact on the development of political, economic, social, cultural relations and interpersonal relations on an international scale, becoming the content and lifestyle for millions of people in the information society. Keywords: project management, tourism sector, creative project. Tourism is one of the leading areas of Ukraine's economy, which provides budget revenues, creates jobs, develops a positive image of the state, increases the competitiveness of national tourism products, has a significant impact on Ukraine's economy. Today, a promising area is the use of creative tourism management technologies within Ukraine. Creativity has the most significant impact on the development of political, economic, social, cultural relations and interpersonal relations on an international scale, becoming the content and lifestyle for millions of people in the information society. The following leading domestic and foreign scientists made a significant contribution to the study of this issue: Boychuk I. [1], Morozov V. [2], Sidun O. [3], Legeida E. [4], Tsirat A. [5], Hayes J. [6], Bisio R. [7]. The leaders in the market of tourist services of Ukraine are tour operators ""Join UP!"", ""Annex tour"" and ""Colar travel"", which serve the majority of tourists in Ukraine. These firms operate as franchises. Table 1 Number of tourists served by tour operators [8] The main parameters of the franchise agreement are the amount of the lump sum Fr , term of the contract T and royalty ratio R0 . The optimization of the problem is reduced to maximizing profits for both the franchisor and the franchisee. We describe the mathematical expectation of profit as a function of demand (1) - (2). For the franchisor (𝑁𝑃𝑉𝐹𝑟) is calculated as: p n n T  R0 (r * D  M 1 (r * D)* f (D)dD  (n * M 0 ) NPV  I  (Fr   0 k 1  (1) Fr 0 j1 t1 (1  d )t For the franchisee (𝑁𝑃𝑉𝑓) is calculated as: p p T  (r * D  M 1 (r * D)* f (D)dD 0 R0 (r * D)* f (D)dD NPV f  Fr   0  (2) Where: t1 (1  d )t I0 – the investment is made by the franchisor; n – number of franchisees; d – rate of return (discount rate); R0 – royalty; M1 – costs paid by the franchisee (to the insurance fund, advertising, training, taxes, etc.); M0 – the cost of maintaining and monitoring the system paid by the franchisor; f(D) – the law of distribution of demand for products; T – number of periods (10); r – profit from the sale of a unit of production; D – demand for products. The flow of domestic tourists is much smaller, due to inefficient and irrational use of natural resource potential, poor transport infrastructure. There is no clear strategy for the development of the tourism industry, which negatively affects the development of the tourism sector in Ukraine [8]. In the GDP of our country, the total contribution of tourism is only 5.4%, while in countries where tourism is well developed, it reaches 10%. Figure 1 – Number of foreign, outbound and domestic tourists in 2000-2020 As a result of the analysis of the situation in the field of tourism, it is proved that Ukraine has great opportunities for the development of creative types of tourism (extreme, historical and cultural, scientific, business, green). It is necessary to expand tourist routes. Improving information systems in tourism and methods of creative management of such projects.

119,Development and Analysis of an Expert System in the Field of Retail Trade of Motor Vehicles,159,"Tsykun V., Khlevna Iu., Khlevnyi A."," Abstract. This work describes the development of an expert system for the estimation of the cost of used cars. Data for used cars from Eastern Europe is analyzed. The practical value of the work is to help ordinary sellers and buyers of used cars to have an idea of how much their car costs on the market, taking into account its characteristics, or what cars are on the market, taking into account the budget. The developed expert system provides the predicted price value for the corresponding parameters. Keywords: expert system, retail, motor vehicles, knowledge base, regression model, data normalization, linear regression, random forest, decision tree. Motor vehicle retailing history began after the start of production of the first cars. Almost every family has sold their car at least once in their life. According to Edmunds.com, an online car review website, about 40 million used cars are sold annually in the United States [1]. According to Ukrainian websites, 80% of all new car registrations in Ukraine were used cars [2]. And in December 2018, the market of used cars in Ukraine was three times higher than sales of new [3]. The field is constantly evolving, so it is clear that it needs the development of technologies for estimating costs of cars. Currently, there are several ways in which experts form the price of a car. This is usually a percentage of the initial cost of the car given the elapsed time since release and the condition of the automobile. However, for the average citizens who want to sell their car, this assessment can be a problem, because they are not experts and can not correctly estimate the cost of the vehicle. It is also important not to disregard the possible dishonesty of appraisal experts or dealers who make a markup. There is a need for an expert system that will provide the calculated price of a used car, analyzing its characteristics (mileage, engine capacity, body type, etc.). Similar systems and algorithms already exist, but they are designed in most cases for the American market and have almost nothing to do with Ukrainian realities. Therefore, the expert system should be based on data from Eastern Europe (CIS). The created expert system will promote the development of the Ukrainian automobile retail market, will help to sell second-hand cars effectively, providing the recommended price, considering only parameters of the vehicle. The purpose of the work is to analyze and develop an expert system for pricing of vehicles in the field of retail trade using machine learning methods. Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple distribution channels for a profit. Pricing in the secondary car market is a topic that interests both sellers and buyers of vehicles. The cost of used cars goes down in direct proportion to their lifespan. However, this is not the only factor that has an objective impact on the price of the vehicle being sold. To predict the value of a car using an expert system, it is necessary to pre- determine the indicators related to price prediction. Literature sources report that it is necessary to consider the following attributes [4]: manufacturer/class - each car brand occupies its segment in the car market: an executive-class car will cost more than an economy class car; type of transmission (gear box) - a car with an automatic transmission costs more than a car with a manual transmission; color - cars with popular colors (black, silver, white) cost more than cars of other colors; mileage - the odometer measure as nothing else affects the price of the vehicle. The higher the odometer, the lower the price of the car; year of manufacture/age - the older the car, the less it costs; engine/fuel type - diesel cars are more expensive than gasoline ones; engine capacity - the larger the volume the higher the price; type of drive - all-wheel drive always increases the price of the car, in contrast to the front one; body type - on average, a station wagon and sedan cost less than a convertible and a coupe. The future expert system will be created based on this data and on methods and models for solving regression problems: linear regression, Random Forest, decision tree regression, LASSO regression and Ridge regression. To analyze and build models, a dataset containing information about used cars will be used in the work. The dataset consists of instances of automobiles: their parameters and the prices at which they were sold. There are both categorical and quantitative attributes in the dataset. Preliminary casual overview and correlation analysis were used to analyze the attributes. From a superficial analysis (with uncleaned data), it became clear that there is a correlation between mileage and price and the year of car production and the price. Some data was cleared from inadequate or unnecessary values: certain attributes that did not have a description or were related to the site from which the data was taken were removed; cars with a year of production of at least 2000 were selected; cars that had the emergency state attribute were removed (i.e. the car was damaged after the accident). Manufacturer and model name metrics have a very large number of unique values, which can complicate analysis and modeling. Therefore, it was decided to remove these indicators and form a common one that will correlate with the price - the class of the car. So we can conditionally divide the manufacturers into three classes (the average price is more than 16,000, the average price is between 10,000 and 16,000 and the average price is less than 10,000) (Figure 1). Figure 1 - Average price for each manufacturer A correlation analysis was performed to further assess the impact of indicators on pricing. Using the resulting correlation map (Figure 2), you can see that age has the greatest correlation with the price of the car. The price also correlates with the value of the odometer, engine capacity, machine class. However, the correlation coefficients between body color, fuel type, engine type, and price are relatively small, i.e. there is no noticeable correlation, so these indicators can be removed from the dataset. Figure 2 - Heats map of attributes correlation After obtaining the necessary data, several algorithms were selected that were most suitable for achieving the goal of the work. Five regression algorithms were selected that previously proved to be the best in the solution of a similar problem. These are the following algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, LASSO Regression, and Ridge Regression. After construction, analysis, and training of the obtained models, the following results were obtained (Table 1). Table 1 Models prediction results The best result was shown by the model based on Random Forest, which is recommended for use in this expert system. Conclusions. In this work, an expert system was developed for use in the automation of price formation in the field of retail trade of motor vehicles. The developed ES makes it possible to give recommendations to the users on the pricing of their cars, depending on the characteristics of the cars. During the development of the ES, knowledge extraction was carried out by analyzing the characteristics of vehicles with regression algorithms. Based on the results of the analysis of the literature and the correlation analysis of the dataset, the main characteristics that affect the price of the car were derived: mileage, age, type of transmission, and class (manufacturer) of the car. Of all the considered models, the Random Forest machine learning algorithm showed the best results - the coefficient of linear determination is 87%. Unfortunately, none of the models showed 90% + accuracy, so the question of improving existing models, adding new data, and using neural networks remains open.

120,Package Managers Security Management,163,"Lukova-Chuiko N., Vdovenko D."," Abstract: Software today has become an assembly of components from a wide range of sources. Individual packages may be developed in-house, acquired from third parties, or downloaded from free and public sources. The security risks of these sources are straightforward to understand in isolation. But, when used in concert, new interactions arise that can compromise even a conscientious organization. Many organizations use public package feeds — such as Maven Central, npm, NuGet Gallery, and the Python Package Index (PyPI) — to take advantage of the open ecosystems they offer. Keywords: Open-source, package managers, typosquatting, dependency confusion. Over the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the scope, quality, and availability of free, open-source software. Even closed-source applications commonly depend on freely shared libraries, tools, and operating systems. A critical factor in this has been the development of ecosystems around package indexes that allow anyone to publish, such as Maven Central, npm, NuGet Gallery, and Python Package Index. A public, open-package index allows anyone to share their code without proving their identity. This ease of publishing has resulted in large, active ecosystems of packages. These ecosystems can include various elements, from generic building blocks to niche, domain-specific algorithms, along with powerful tools for discovering, acquiring, and composing these packages. Organizations (or “clients”) use private feeds as package index mirrors or to distribute internal packages to protect against upstream compromises, such as package hijacking and typo-squatting. Package management tools typically allow specifying multiple sources from which to download components, making it easy to consume from public and private indexes. This hybrid configuration can enable new ways for attackers to enter your systems through otherwise secure infrastructure due to how package management tools resolve names across multiple sources. Typosquatting, also called URL hijacking, a sting site, or a fake URL, is a form of cybersquatting, and possibly brandjacking which relies on mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser. Should a user accidentally enter an incorrect website address, they may be led to any URL (including an alternative website owned by a cybersquatter) [1]. The misguided traffic is then often monetized either with advertisements or malicious attacks such as drive-by downloads or exploit kits. Whether and how the concept behind DNS typosquatting can be transferred to other use cases? By using the programming language Python for several years, I learned that the third-party package manager pip (a command-line application) is used to install software libraries from Python’s community repository named PyPi. The natural question is: how many users do commit typos when issuing an installation command in the terminal by using pip [2]? Because everybody can upload any package on PyPi, it is possible to create packages that are typo versions of popular packages that are prone to be mistyped. And if somebody unintentionally installs such a package, the next question comes intuitively: Is it possible to run arbitrary code and take over the computer during the installation process of a package? We can create a fake package that has a similar name as a famous package on PyPi, Npmjs.com, or rubygems.org. For example, we could upload a package named reqeusts instead of the famous requests module. We have investigated that it is possible to create such typo package names in three different ways [3]: Creative typo names like coffe-script instead of coffee-script. Often only humans can create creative typo names because its creation process requires an intuitive understanding of what grammatical mistake is easy to make with the origin name. Stdlib typos or core package names like urllib2. Stdlib typos are package names that do exist in the core of the language but haven't registered in the third-party package manager yet. Algorithmically determined typo names like req7est instead of request. Algorithmically typo candidates are suggestions from algorithms like the Levenshtein distance. Shortly, defenses against typosquatting are [4]: Prevent Direct Code Execution on Installations This one is easy. Make sure that the software that unpacks and installs a third-party package (pip or npm) does not allow the execution of code that originates from the package itself. Only when the user explicitly loads the package, the library code should be executed. Generate a List of Potential Typo Candidates Generate Levenshtein distance candidates for the most downloaded N packages of the repository and alarm administrators on registration of such a candidate. Analyze log files and prevent registration of often shadow installed packages Whenever a user makes a typo by installing a package and the package is not registered yet, a logfile entry on the repository server is created (because the install HTTP requests target a non-existent resource). Parse these failed installations and prevent all such names that are shadow installed more than a reasonable threshold per month. Early February 2021, the author came across an article [5] that spoke about a novel supply chain attack based on dependency package naming conventions. The attack consisted of uploading malware to open-source repositories such as PyPI, NPM, and RubyGems, and naming them such that they would be downloaded and used by the target company’s application. Dependency confusion is a novel attack, and we need to define what is a dependency, how dependency confusion works, and how we can protect our codebase from this attack [6]. Dependencies are code modules packaged for easy consumption in the application code that you write. It is a code reusability mechanism for commonly public or non-public solved problems and is directly imported via installation into your applications [6]. One common hybrid configuration that clients use is storing internal packages on a private feed but allowing the retrieval of dependencies from a public feed. This ensures that the latest package releases are automatically adopted when referenced from a package that does not need to be updated. Internal developers publish their packages to this private feed, and consumers check both private and public feeds for the best available versions of the required packages. This configuration presents a supply chain risk: the dependency confusion attack [7]. A dependency confusion attack happens when an attacker discovers that a client is using a private package that is not present on the public feed. After the attacker uploads a higher version of the private package to the feed, the client downloads it automatically because it has the same file name. Services that merge package feeds also allow this substitution if packages from public sources may override those from private sources [7]. Figure 1 – Example of a dependency request path There are a lot of possible mitigation strategies – from caching and reviewing every requested package in the internal network to whitelisting approved public packages for software development. The author considers mitigation strategies proposed by Twilio and Microsoft [6, 7]: Naming conventions for all internal packages. Reference one private feed, not multiple. Protect packages using controlled scopes. block proxying of certain packages. Internal package manager as a single source. Utilize client-side verification features. Restrict deployed hosts from accessing the registry. Controls for laptop access.

121,A model for determining the proficiency of the workers of educators of higher education institutions,166,Wang Yi.," Four-step model of proficiency progress The cycle of proficiency progress (Figure 1) begins with the process of orientation, in which the student determines which capability he wants to develop. Once this decision has been made, the student has a choice. One very fast way typical of non-formal learning and leisure-related proficiencies is to move directly to proficiency-based proficiency progress activities and little knowledge of their current level of language proficiency. Another way, more related to formal education and professional progress, is to start collecting information about the current level of student proficiency. Then the student can choose again: either he has his level of proficiency officially distinguished by others, or he can move directly to the activity of proficiency progress. Again, the latter way is a more informal learning way [1]. Figure 1 - Cycles of student proficiency progress It is very significant to realize that the formal learning way is not yet completely formal. In fact, the assessments of others are the point where the formal learning path begins, where prior learning, which can be either informal or formal, turns into formal recognition. When a cycle occurs for the first time, the moment of evaluation is often referred to by others as ""initial estimates"". This cycle of proficiency progress is largely based on studies by Duvekot, R. C., Schuur, K., Paulusse, J. [3, 4]. However, focusing on the individual student, aspects such as the enterprise of learning and awareness of enterprises remain out of consideration. Presentation of the main research results Human resource management depends on policies and operations and systems that affect workers behavior, attitudes and execution. Human resource management is a process that includes 4 tasks: attracting, progress, motivating and retaining human resources. Therefore, the tasks of personnel management are to achieve the desired results of joint efforts of workers: Recruitment of workers with a level of salary that meets the needs of the enterprise; Education and progress of talents and skills of workers; Support of personnel capability and creation of conditions for favorable relations between them; Providing conditions to meet the material and spiritual needs of workers, while maintaining a balance between individual aims of workers and the aims of the enterprise. The selection strategy is the stage of accepting or rejecting the request. The selected employee must be not only the utmost qualified, but also the utmost harmoniously suited to the team and the tasks of the enterprise (5). The applicant declares his readiness to participate in the work, sending the necessary documents. Thus, the first stage of human resource management concerns the involvement of workers, and the second stage - the acquisition of skills, renewal and promotion of workers through training. Thus, for enterprises, human resource progress through training is an integral process that promotes the progress of abilities and talents, increases professional knowledge of workers, forms a positive attitude to corporate aims and ultimately influences workers behavior and, consequently, increases productivity. Human resource progress plays a very significant role in the progress of the enterprise (6). Also, William James (1995) from Harvard University in a study concluded that employees of enterprises use from 20 to 30 percent of their learning opportunities. His research showed that with specialized incentives, workers show 80 to 90 percent of their training opportunities. Therefore, human resource management plays an significant role at various levels, including: Introduction, acquisition of skills, renewal and promotion of effective teaching skills [7]. An significant role is played by the criteria for evaluating workers for advanced training. Thus, the basic criteria for selection at Yancheng Polytechnic Institute (PRC, Jiangsu Province) are 5 criteria: general cultural, general professional, communicative, individual, self-progress and self-education (Fig. 2). To determine the level of educators, the method of expert evaluation of each of the criteria on a scale from 0 to 10 points. The minimum selection limit is 5 points for each of the criteria [8]. However, according to the author, this methodology can be upgraded due to three criterias. First, the current 5 criteria do not sufficiently reflect the level of the educator. Therefore, it is advisable to increase these criteria. Secondly, the methodology of expert assessment should be expanded to include in the circle of experts different groups of people who are in contact with the educator (students, colleagues, administration). For this purpose, in addition, the use of a universal computer program for calculations of quantitative assessment of teaching quality is suitable [9]. Third, conduct mandatory educator testing. The emphasis should be not only on professional skills, but also on the so-called ""soft skills"" - non-professional skills that are necessary for success teamwork. Figure 2 – Criteria for selection of Yancheng Polytechnic Institute to increase the professional proficiency of educators To upgrade the definition of the proficiency of the workers of educators of higher education institutions, the following model has been developed, which includes three levels of assessment. Soft skills criteria have been added to the required criteria. Testing is recommended for both professional and psychological parameters. Expert assessment was expanded, two additional groups were involved: a group of colleagues, a group of students. Figure 3 – A model for determining the proficiency of the workers of educators of higher education institutions is proposed Conclusion A model for determining the proficiency of the workers of educators of higher education institutions has been developed, which includes three levels of assessment. Soft skills criteria have been added to the required criteria. Testing is recommended for both professional and psychological parameters. Expert assessment was expanded, two additional groups were involved: a group of colleagues, a group of students. It is expected that this model will allow more professional and effective assessment of the proficiency of teaching workers. Subsequent research will focus on testing this model.

122,Development of Methods for Solving the Partner Selection Problem,170,Xu H.," Annotation. In the conditions of intensive development of scientific communities' mobility to ensure openness of innovations, it is essential to rationalize the choice of partners rational. The article considers a conceptual model of research on the problem of choosing partners for the implementation of research or educational projects. The article defines the general requirements for the development of information technology to select potential partners for research and educational projects. Keywords. .Partner selection problem, scientific project, multi-objective optimization To effectively organize the preparatory stage of finding a solution to the problem of finding partners for a research project, you can perform several steps: Determine to which direction or directions the activity of potential partners (object or subject of research activity) can be attributed. Assess the contribution of partners in the development of scientific areas. That is, to assess the importance of partners in communities united by scientific directions. Select those potential partners that correspond to the project, project work packages, and individual work package tasks. Thus, finding partners for cooperation within research projects is related to the task of identifying scientific research areas. The modern development of science and innovation testifies to the growing degree of interdisciplinarity. The paper [1] proposes the following ways to identify areas of research: calculation of the index of integration or disciplinary diversity; construction of a similarity matrix for each thematic category and grouping of elements of the thematic group; generating maps to visualize communication within directions. The next step in the preparatory stage of the task of finding partners is to assess the contribution of partners in the development of the relevant scientific field. It is first necessary to identify the links between all scientific publications through citations between these publications. The identified links between scientific publications open up opportunities for clustering these publications by the scientific field. Each research field will include a certain number of authors of publications that belong to a specific field or cluster. Thus, it is possible to put following a particular author a certain amount of areas of research, ie, to identify research areas of the authors. The scientific field's potential will be determined by evaluating the research activities of scientists who belong to this field. In essence, clusters or areas of research can be seen as dynamic objects with a history of development and predictable potential. In the third step, you need to select those partners who meet the entry conditions. Articles [2] describe some methods for selecting partners. The key factors influencing the creation of standard forms of scientific cooperation are described in [3]. It determined that the main factors are the level of reputation of agents and the features of cooperation mechanisms. Mathematical methods for selecting partners for cooperation are described in [4]. In [5], the method of the analytical hierarchy using for this problem. In [6], it proposed to use a modification of the genetic algorithm for this task. Theoretical aspects of the formation of factors for the selection of partners for cooperation in innovative projects are given in [7]. The process of selecting partners in joint international enterprises is described in [8]. Some aspects of this process can be used to choose partners for research and educational projects. If the number of potential partners significantly exceeds the possibilities of their involvement in the project, you can use the specific selection methods proposed in this work. Consider the conceptual model of partner selection, the scheme of which is shown in Figure 1. The main components of the conceptual model are: Defining criteria for selecting potential partners. Applying the multi-objective optimization. Applying Delphi method. Building the preferences of partners or project executors. Deciding on assigning partners project tasks that meet the relevant work package. Figure 8 – The conceptual scheme for solving the problem of finding partners for research or educational project. The main stages of deciding on the choice of partners according to the presented concept are as follows: Formation of a preliminary list of potential partners. Defining criteria for selecting partners. Application of the method of multi-objective optimization to choose a set of optimal partners. Application of the expert method for assessment of the received set of partners on conformity to requirements. Forming a matrix of partner preferences. Determining the ranked list of potential partners. Final selection of partners to perform specific tasks of the relevant work package of the research project. Let a finite set of potential executors of these projects be given 𝑉 t is the number of potential partners. Partners can be scientists, project managers, research institutions, higher education institutions, etc. The decision on whether to select partners to implement the relevant work package is made by the project management team or the decision-maker. You can use the method of aggregation of expert assessments to determine the optimal composition of the executors of work packages of each of the projects. Let a set of experts be given Each of the experts makes the preferences of potential performers, taking into account the vector of criteria. An incomplete benefit profile is allowed. Let 𝜉𝑖𝑗𝑗 , 𝑗𝑗 = 1, 𝑟𝑖, 𝑖 = 1, 𝑛 is the average frequency of occurrence of each of the benefits between potential performers 𝑣𝑐 and 𝑣𝑏, 𝑣𝑐 ∈ 𝑉, 𝑣𝑏 ∈ 𝑉, 𝑐 ≠ 𝑏. Then we obtain a matrix of advantages of the form [13]: Using methods of forming a collective solution based on a matrix of pairwise comparisons, it is possible for each package 𝑔𝑖 of project 𝐺𝑖 get an orderly list of potential performers: Given this list, the project manager selects specific contractors and forms a working group.

123,Possibilities and Relevance of Telemedicine Implementation in Governmental Electronic Medical Systems,173,"Zaremba O., Khlevna Iu."," Abstract. This study was conducted due to the growing relevance of telemedicine services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It outlines the prospects for the implementation of the telemedicine system in the state electronic health care systems, the main stakeholders for the implementation of this project and some successful examples of the launch of telemedicine platforms by foreign governments. In addition, the analysis identifies the main problems that are obstacles and risks in launching such systems. Keywords: telemedicine, COVID-19, government, electronic systems. As of today, world`s health care systems are still affected by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Ukraine's medical system is maximally mobilized to combat COVID-19, but the risks of infection for medical professionals and hospital patients remain disproportionately high. [1] Such statistics are due to the contact of doctors with patients who have severe form of the disease, but also with those who have no symptoms or mild form of the disease but have to visit doctors to get the diagnosis. In addition, the risk of contact with patients with COVID-19 often forces people with chronic diseases to avoid visiting hospitals and clinics, leaving without medical care people, who often need it most. However, these days it`s possible to use information technology in electronic systems to reduce such risks. The analysis presented in this paper shows that the implementation of a telemedicine in electronic medical systems can provide major benefits in maintaining the safety of health professionals and ordinary citizens. This work outlines the prospects for the introduction of telemedicine services in public health systems and the expected obstacles to the implementation of such innovations, as well as demonstrates successful examples of such services abroad, which we hope will begin discussing such a possibility in Ukraine. Telemedicine is especially relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. By providing the opportunity for communication between the patient and the doctor it helps to protect medical professionals and patients from the spread of viral diseases. And for the patients themselves, it is an opportunity to get a diagnosis and treatment faster, which will help prevent the spread of the virus by this person, allow treatment to begin immediately and allow the patient's condition to be monitored, so that in case of unexpected complications there is a possibility to respond quickly. Telemedicine services are crucial for people at risk of complications from COVID-19 infection, people that have chronic diseases, and for people with limited mobility. For these citizens, personal visits to the hospital or clinic may be difficult due to the risk of infection, or a lockdown that restricts movement for citizens, and the telemedicine system may provide regular consultations for these groups without the need to visit medical facilities. Undoubtedly, the unprecedented workload of the medical system has a strong impact on the ability of doctors to implement and apply the latest technologies. Lack of time, which until ten years ago was one of the least significant obstacles to the introduction of telemedicine [2], is now becoming a major problem due to the volume of work related to COVID-19. Insufficient computer skills, which are often cited by health professionals as a reason to avoid using a telemedicine system, if available, can also be a significant obstacle [2]. However lately the computer awareness is increasing, and the motivation of physicians to use remote video communication technologies with patients and colleagues is growing. Due to their centralization and prevalence, provision of such a service by government agencies can help to circumvent several problems, including issues of legal regulation, sources of funding and the unpopularity of the service. Of course, there are shortcomings in the idea, such as low rates of innovation, low probability of implementation of experimental projects and distrust in the protection of personal information during operation. However, there are already successful examples of the implementation of telemedicine by governments. For example, the Dubai Health Department launched a service called ""Doctor for every citizen."" With help of this service all residents can access free consultation through audio and video calls [9]. There is an example of the Government of India, which launched the application ""Dial-A-Doctor"". Patients now can communicate digitally with doctors [10]. Also, Lithuania currently has several national projects that seek to integrate information and communication technologies into the country's medical system to provide telecommunications services to the country's citizens [11]. In my opinion, the project approach will be the most successful for the implementation of such plan. It is suitable for both small and large-scale national projects, and thanks to its methodology makes it possible to achieve the goals in a timely manner and within the defined budget. The main stakeholders of such a project and their impact on the project can be: The project`s team can be divided in five parts: product development division, advisory division, implementation division, support division and leadership division. Product development division is responsible for UX/UI design, coding, test and quality assurance, as well as completion of administrative process. Advisory division that consists of Ministry of health expert, National Health Service of Ukraine expert and an appointed team from the medical institution is identifying a need which the service must satisfy to be approved, defines success, outlines risks and advice to avoid them. Implementation division is responsible for carrying out the enforcing of the system in the institution and organizing training for medical professionals regarding the system. Support division aids after the implementation of the telemedicine system. Leadership division provides planning, budgetary approval, decision-making, monitoring and maintains the workplace culture. Team roles required for the project are the following: Project manager, Business analyst, Ministry of health expert, National Health Service of Ukraine expert, UX designer, UI designer, Front-end developers, Back-end developers, Quality assurance engineer, Product owner. Such team composition would allow for the swift and timely completion of the workflow steps, while also maintaining the structure agile enough to react to possible goal changes without delay. Conclusions. At present, telemedicine services are in high demand among patients, especially for those with chronic diseases, disabilities, or suspected COVID-19. The telemedicine system is also useful for doctors - to prevent viral infections and to consult with colleagues. The introduction of telemedicine services based on state electronic systems is particularly promising, but it faces such threats and risks as: workload and insufficient computer skills by doctors, slow implementation of innovations by the state and distrust by citizens. However, in the international arena there are already examples of successful implementation of telemedicine by the state, which indicates the possibility of successful implementation of such a system in Ukraine.

124,HR in international educational service system,177,Huan Zh.," It is beyond doubt, that the importance of human resource management (HRM) in enterprises is very high. The need to harmonize HRM and business strategies is widely known [1]. Effective HRM is vital to meet ever-changing market demands [2]. Technology and HRM have a wide range of influences on each other, and HR experts must be able to implement technologies that reengineer the personnel management function, be prepared to support enterprise and operational changes due to technology development, and be able to maintain proper management. climate for innovative and knowledge-intensive enterprises [3]. High-tech advances are advancing primarily due to the high demands of human resources experts to rise speed, efficiency and reduce costs [4]. Studies by Snell, Stuiber and Lepak [5] have shown that through the use of IT, human resource management systems can solve problems more criticalally, flexibly, cost-effectively and more customer-oriented. Many experts predict that the PC will become a central device for all experts in the field of HR [6]. Virtualization of human resources management is caused by the factor of increasing complexity of IT and increasing external structural parameters [7]. IT enables enterprises to carry out relevant human resource management operations. And a wide range of proposals in the market of human resource management technologies allows you to use the latest systems with minimal investment [8]. Presentation of the main research results The development of the Chinese international service system for students is ongoing, but according to the author is not fast enough. For example, the program is presented, which is currently enrolling foreign students in one of the universities of Shandong Province (Fig. 1-3). Figure 1 – Screenshot of the main menu of the international service system for students Figure 2 – Screenshot of the menu of choosing specialties of the international service system for students Figure 3 – Screenshot of a student's personal questionnaire in the international service system for students Although this system is aimed at facilitating the enrollment and further education of students, but its functionality is limited. There is a single integration of higher education institutions of this system with internal human resource management services, but it has not yet reached global development. To globalize the learning process of foreign students, it is advisable to use an consolidated learning platform. A number of training courses have been developed for this platform. The Master of Business Administration course was adopted to conduct a joint Ukrainian-Chinese training program (Figure 4). Figure 4 – Screenshot of the main page of the consolidated learning platform According to the author, the harmonization of the Chinese international service system for students and an consolidated learning platform will rise the level of human resource management for educational institutions. Conclusion To globalize the learning process of foreign students, it is advisable to use an consolidated learning platform. A number of training courses have been developed for this platform. The Master of Business Administration course was adopted to conduct a joint Ukrainian-Chinese training program. Harmonization of the Chinese international student service system and consolidated learning platform will rise the level of human resource management for educational institutions.

125,Agile methodology for joint educational programs implementation,180,Zhu T.," In 2012, a study was conducted to evaluate the use of the Agile approach to curricula [1]. A pilot educational program for project management students has been developed and implemented. The first pilot project was a one-month, divided into four ""sprints"" per week. Each sprint had its own set of goals. Agile ""persons"" based on the nature of students, parents, teachers and others have been developed to know exactly how to provide value that meets their needs. The concept of using Agile as an approach to teaching and learning is not new [2- 7]. However, while related articles appear periodically in publications such as the Journal of Information Systems Education (JISE) and other educational publications in the field of information systems, there are very few sources where such materials have been systematized and conveniently presented in a separate manual [8]. One study [9] observed 74 students from 4 groups studying the discipline of ""information systems"" (introduction to computer engineering, programming, analytics and data mining), from freshmen to senior groups, and those studying IP by specialty, and those who have a general course. The obtained results testify to interesting conclusions concerning the differences between the sexes during individual and pair work; the quality of the decision based on age, motivation, individual or pair work, and perception of the concept of work performed; and the influence of experimental parameters between the first year (introduction to computer science) and the senior course (data mining). The authors suggest that pairwise programming may not necessarily be ""a key factor influencing changes in attitudes"" or ""consistently associated with improved solution quality."" In addition, the type of ""subject is less important for improving the quality of the solution compared to the possibility of involvement in pair programming"" and ""the perception of the course differs at different levels of academic training."" The study supports the idea that pair programming can be implemented in courses outside of software development and provides a new perspective on gender differences, and other activities practiced in a flexible methodology can improve the quality of material perception. Scrum is used to facilitate self-regulated learning in the introductory programming course within the Doubtfire Learning Management System (LMS) [9]. The author presents an interesting, unconventional approach as opposed to the traditional approach to programming. Presentation of the main research results KanbanFlow is an online tool for both individual and collaborative work on ""cost-effective development"" projects with the Kanban methodology [10]. The service allows you to add several kanban boards to make plans and track work on various projects. The service is suitable for both personal productivity and project and team management. As soon as any member of the team makes changes to the board, these changes are displayed on all screens of the team. So, if you add, delete or move the task to yourself, the same action will be repeated in the rest of the team. If desired, you can track the time spent on the task with a timer. The timer supports the popular Pomodoro method for time management. Figures 1 - 3 show the task board and subtasks of the specialized bachelor training program ""3 + 1"" in KanbanFlow. Figure 1 – Task board of the specialized program of preparation of bachelors ""3 + 1"" in KanbanFlow Figure 2 – Task menu for the specialized bachelor training program ""3 + 1"" in KanbanFlow Figure 3 – The menu of assignments of subtasks in KanbanFlow The use of modern software accelerates the management of a complex project of a specialized program for bachelors ""3 + 1"". Agile's approach of dividing tasks into sprints, building a Kanban board and attracting a student as a ""customer"" has proved very successful. The KanbanFlow online tool has never been used before for this task. Its use has reduced the time spent on project management and improved the interaction of the international team, which consists of Ukrainian and Chinese specialists. The preparation of training materials is divided into sprints, with further improvements throughout the implementation of the program. The main ""customer"" in this program is a student, and the ultimate goal of each project under the program - the competence of the student in the labor market after graduation. Therefore, this program can be considered complex, and one that is constantly evolving, as the needs of the Chinese labor market are constantly changing and evolving. Conclusion When planning the learning process can increasingly be done using the principles of Agile methodology. Higher education institutions that implement a joint international training program are no exception. This is how a joint educational project between the Petro Mohyla Black Sea National University and the Yanchen Polytechnic Institute called “3 + 1” is being prepared. This program is planned using Agile approaches, namely using the Kanban methodology. This uses KanbanFlow software. The KanbanFlow online tool has never been used before for this task. Its use has reduced the time spent on project management and improved the interaction of the international team, which consists of Ukrainian and Chinese specialists.
