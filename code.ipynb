The article describes how the Internet of Things can improve everyday life, including nutrition and health monitoring. Keywords: Healthy Eating, nutrition, іnternet of Things, information technology, lifestyle INTRODUCTION Ukraine is among the top ten countries with the highest mortality risk from an unbalanced diet, according to a study by The Lancet magazine [1]. Among the main reasons are excessive sugar, salt, and meat consumption. According to WHO, 70% of a person's health depends on what he eats [2]. It has been scientifically proven that irrational nutrition significantly affects a person's life expectancy and leads to the emergence and development of non-infectious diseases: cardiovascular, diabetes, and metabolic disorders. A balanced diet is a unique tool that can strengthen human health, improve the body's adaptive capabilities and, most importantly, prevent the development of many diseases. In turn, the Internet of Things provides powerful tools to collect and process different data. Sensors and devices connected to Internet can be used for monitoring and improving our health and nutrition. Application for planning balanced nutrition Considering the above information, it is advisable to examine the possibility and prospects of developing an information system for planning balanced nutrition. The end product should help the end user to form a personal plan for a balanced diet and provide an opportunity to monitor his eating behavior in the form of statistics. With the help of this application, we want to offer ways to solve the problem of an unhealthy eating trends, such as insufficient information support, spending a lot of time on following a balanced diet, spending a lot of material resources on a balanced diet. It is essential to address these issues, as unhealthy eating is detrimental to our health and overall quality of life. The application should include the following modules: meal planning module: input and processing of personal data, an algorithm for forming a meal plan, planning purchases according to a meal plan; food diary module: logging of consumed products and dishes, reactions of the body to consumed food; food behavior statistics module: generation of reports based on the diary; communication module with specialists: the creation of appointments with specialists. Internet of Things Overview The Internet of Things is the concept of connecting any device (if it has an on/off switch) to the Internet and other connected devices. IoT represents a vast database in which intelligent sharing devices are known through sensors, electronics, system network, and hardware [3]. Communication between devices can occur between different physical objects, for example, in the office / home. Some examples of devices with IoT integration are lighting devices, smoke alarms, etc. Basically, devices that users can connect to any other device or via the Internet. Creating a personal eco-system of connected devices can allow us to bring many smart features into our everyday life. USING IOT FOR HEALTHY EATING The diagram shows an example of IoT eco-system that can be deployed for improving healthy eating [Figure 1]. Figure 1: IoT for Healthy Eating example As we can see from the figure, the following elements are involved in our future eco-system: User. A user is a person who will be the final consumer of the results that will be produced by the eco-system. The user is primarily interested in improving his nutrition. At the moment, he realizes that his diet is unbalanced and far from WHO recommendations. The user is worried about his health and is ready to start improving the quality of his life. However, he has very limited knowledge about balanced nutrition. Smart devices: Smart watches. Smartwatches have become an important device in our life. Heart monitors are included in wearable technologies and are used to measure heart rates. Smartwatches allow measuring spent calories. This could be helpful for people with diabetes, obesity, or other chronic diseases who comply with a specific diet advised by their care providers [4]. Smart scales. The smart scales can now connect to your smartphone and show you a collection of metrics from weight to body composition. Smart refrigerator. The Smart refrigerator not only stores food but also allows you to use the Internet, through which you can access hundreds of different recipes for cooking and even order food from online stores with home delivery. Smart cooking devices. All the functionality of the multicooker and even more will be available on your smartphone. From a distance, you can give commands: cook / do not cook (stew, fry, in general, start cooking), cook at a higher / lower temperature, end one program and switch to another, switch to the dish heating mode, and so on. Applications: Application for creating a personal plan for balanced nutrition. The application should help the end user to form a personal plan for a balanced diet, provide an opportunity to monitor his eating behavior in the form of statistics, and provide an opportunity to receive informational support from nutritionists [5]. Smart home application. Smart Home is an Android/IOS application that allows you to match your lifestyle and seamlessly control all aspects of your property, including lighting, climate, appliances, curtains and blinds, multi-room audio/video, security, digital video surveillance, entertainment and energy saving anywhere in the world. How this will work together. The first part. In real time, the smart watch will collect a certain overflow of parameters about the user, such as his heart rate, activity, the number of calories burned, trends inherent to the user during the day, sleep statistics, and others. These data will be transferred to the user's phone, and part of them will be used by the application for planning a balanced diet. Based on the received data, this application will determine the daily calorie needs of a given user and analyze the user's lifestyle and basic health parameters to take these indicators into account when planning a personalized diet[6]. Smart Scales not only measure weight but are also able to calculate the percentage of muscle mass in the body, measure fluids in the body, and the percentage of bone mass in the body. These indicators will be transmitted to the user's watch and phone. And again, they will be used by the application for planning a balanced diet. With this data, the application for creating personal plan for balanced nutrition can generate more accurate statistics and provide the best recommendations. A smart refrigerator and smart cooking devices are designed to simplify the process of preparing dishes that the application will recommend. Smart functions will help reduce the amount of time spent on cooking, preparing, and purchasing products. The second part. The second part of the user's interaction with the IoT eco-system begins with the moment when the user starts to follow the nutritious plan that the application suggested. According to the concept, the user should log the body's reaction to the nutrition plan. Then the application will start forming statistics, enriching it also with data from smart devices. Thus, we have a continuous interaction process between devices and the user. CONCLUSION In this article, we have described a personalized IoT eco-system that can provide the user with tools to manage and improve their diet. Using a smart watch, smart scales, smart refrigerator, smart devices for cooking, as well as appropriate applications, the user can easily monitor the main indicators of your health, get basic recommendations for healthy eating, follow a meal plan, record changes in the body depending on the food consumed, receive generated personalized nutrition and health statistics, improve and simplify life.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As a result of the decomposition of the subject area, the classification of projects of educational environments is made, and the task of optimal management in the design-vector space is formulated. The research enables us to proceed to formalization of educational environment management processes. We will define the basic definition of this part of the research. Definition 1. By project-vector management of educational environments, we will understand the implementation of functions that ensure the organization, planning, and control of the distribution of available resources between the objects of educational environments and ensure their maximum rapid progress in the project-vector space. Mathematically, the multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments will reflect the vectors formed in the project-vector space (direction of change of objects), evaluate and adjust them based on the needs of stakeholders and project goals. The project-vector space contains a set of objects and subjects of the projects developing in time. The development of the objects and subjects of the projects corresponds to the movement in the project-vector space. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments will be carried out through the evaluation of the distance between the vectors reflecting the required and development of objects/subjects of projects. Mathematically, a set of vectors can represent the unit movements of project objects and subjects in the discrete project-vector space. Each vector coordinate represents the place of the object/subject of the project in one of the measurements at the current moment in time. The endpoint of these movements is the end of the project and the collapse of the project-vector space again (for the project that has ended) into a point. Each vector is defined by coordinates that reflect the state at some discrete point in time t of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk in the project space  : A( j ) ( t )  x(j) (t), x(j) (t),..., x(j) (t),..., x(j) (t), k\\t\\tk1\\tk2\\tki\\tkp\\t\\t(1) where x (j) (t) – the coordinate value of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk along the Ni axis in the project-vector space at time t. The motion vector determines the priority measurements (priority values of the project) and is defined through the magnitude of the change in the distance along the given directions per quantum of time. Building an effective project management system is not the \"aspirations\" of individual objects that matter but how similar or different their movement vectors are in the project-vector space. The same vectors mean that the movements of different project objects are equally predetermined. Therefore, a single system (or subsystem) of management of these projects can be created. In order to create an effective multisystem of project management, it is necessary to group projects in such a way that the distance between vectors of projects included in one group is minimal. The coordinates of the vectors in each measurement are as different as the attributes of the objects and subjects of the projects displayed in this measurement. It is necessary to develop a mathematical apparatus for calculating the distance between the directions of development of objects and the subjects of projects. This will make it possible to create optimal functional procedures for the formation of vectors and minimize the time and cost of creating a multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments. The mathematical apparatus of vector algebra is used to calculate the distances between vectors and determine the optimal set of groups of projects (and, respectively, the subsystems of the multisystem of project management). Assume that for some time interval dt the coordinate value of some object/subject Qj of the project Пk change from the value x(j) (t - dt), x(j) (t - dt),..., x(j) (t - dt),..., x(j) (t - dt) , to the value x(j) (t), x(j) (t),...,x(j) (t),...,x(j) (t) k1\\tk2\\tki kp\\t, где t − instant of time; dt – the time quantum of the discrete project-vector space. Then the value corresponding to the development of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk,can be determined from the formula l (j) (t)  k\\t, where l (j) (t) − the vector estimate of the change of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk at time t (instantaneous displacement velocity). However, there is one peculiarity in the design-vector space. In operations on vectors, the distance between them in some measurement is given by the difference of coordinates in that measurement. This cannot be used to calculate the degree of proximity of different vectors. Firstly, because the direction of the object/subject cannot be evaluated over small discrete time instants, it is necessary to evaluate them over a sufficiently long-time interval. Secondly, the creation of a single system (subsystem) of management of many projects is based not only on the \"unidirectional\" development of individual objects and subjects of projects but also on their proximity in the project-vector space. For example, whether the same methods or means of project management are used, the same performers, and whether the same input information is used. The two problems will be solved.</td>\n",

Many works are devoted to the problem of creating efficient algorithms for solving problems of high dimensionality, when the brute-force search methods become too time-consumin. This work is also devoted to the development of an efficient algorithm in the field of expert evaluation problems, namely, the algorithm for solving the problem of collective evaluation coordination. The main goal of this work is to implement in software the algorithm for the near search of the compromice median, which is sometimes called the GV-median. It is also necessary to investigate the program for performance at different values of input parameters. Keywords: expert evaluation, collective evaluation, coordination of individual expert evaluations, algorithm of near search of GV-median. Introduction. The problem of ordering a set of objects by the degree of manifestation of some properties is one of the most common problems of expert evaluation [1]. This class of problems formalizes a large number of practical problems in various subject areas. Since such problems are NP-hard, much attention is paid by researchers to the development and research of methods that significantly accelerate the finding of solutions to such problems. Usually, the acceleration of problem solutions is carried out due to the successful determination of the problem structure and the successful use of the features of the structure of admissible solutions. Features of nearest search problems. The classification of ranking problems is quite wide. Problems with the following parameters will be considered for the application of the GV-median nearest search algorithm: expert information about the relationship on the set of objects is used: from the expert committee; input information: individual expert assessments; metric for determining the distance between object ranks in the decision space: the module of differences between object ranks; class of relations between objects for which algorithms for finding a solution are built: strict rankings of objects; type of criterion of optimality of the optimization problem: minimax criterion. Software implementation. Python language was chosen for software implementation. One of the most influential disadvantages of Python is the speed of code execution, however, Python programs are usually written much faster due to the relative conciseness of the language and a wide range of libraries. In addition, using Python increases the readability of the code for other developers. Algorithm of the nearest search of the GV-median. The nearest search algorithm can be represented by a sequence of the following steps: Step 1. The input is k rankings of n objects that will be designated Ri , i  1,..., k, and represented as a matrix Ak, n. (1) Let us transform the matrix of object numbers Ak, n in individual rankings of the form (1) into the corresponding matrix of object ranks B k, n. Step 2. Calculate the distance matrix D k, k  between the rankings of the form by the rank mismatch metric using the formula n i\\tj\\ti\\tj l\\tl (2) where l 1 i denotes the rank of l object in the ranking of i expert Step 3. We look for the maxima along the rows of the matrix D(k,k), and among them we determine the minimum (or minima, if this value is not the only one). This minimum corresponds to the modified GV-median (also called the compromise median). The solution may not be unique. We track the row from which the GV-median was taken and look at the distances for which rankings were calculated in it. This ranking will be considered as a reference. Define the vector of ranks of the reference ranking as Ko  r0 ,..., r0 , and by Ro  a0 ,..., a0 , denote the order of objects in 1\\tn\\t1\\tn the reference ranking. Step 4. Around the reference ranking we look for the closest to it, that is, those that are at a distance of 2. Their number is exactly n 1 ranking. To do this, it is necessary to swap the neighboring elements in pairs and calculate the distance matrix and the modified GV-median for them. If the new median delivers a lower criterion value, it becomes the new reference. The ranking obtained in the end is the closest to the rankings set by the experts for the given criteria. Computational experiment. The tendency of increasing time consumption with increasing number of objects and experts is obvious. By conducting a computational experiment, we will determine the specific time required to solve problems of different dimensions. The computational experiment was conducted for variations of different parameters: with a fixed number of experts k  10 and a variable number of objects 4  n  50 , as well as with a fixed number of objects n  10 and a variable number of experts 4  k  50 . The results of the computational experiment are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Figure 1. Time in seconds to solve the problem with the number of experts 10 k  10 and the number of objects in the rankings from 4 to 50 4  n  50 With a fixed number of objects and a variable number of experts, it is expected that the dependence of the solution time on the number of experts is close to linear. Figure 2. Time in seconds to solve the problem for the number of objects in the rankings 10 n  10 and the number of experts from 4 to 50 4  k  50 It should be noted that the time complexity of the constructed algorithm for the nearest median search is O k 2n2  . The computational experiment also investigated the percentage of improvement of the result compared to the reference ranking. The results are presented in Figure 3. It is obvious that for a small number of experts k  10 the improvement reaches 30% on average. For a larger number of experts 10  k  50 the improvement reaches about 15%. At the same time, the improvement rate of the result when applying the genetic algorithm was only 3-5% [2], however, for a large number of objects n  500. Figure 3. Percentage of improvement of the result (criteria values at the GV- median) for the number of objects n  10 and the number of experts from 4 to 50 4  k  50 Conclusions. Humanity will not abandon the methods of solving the problems of collective coordination for a long time, because expert opinion is the only way to provide an assessment of objects, a full description of all the impacts on which is very complex and confusing. That is why the development and creation of new methods of working with expert assessments is necessary for more efficient use of available resources.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract. New malicious software fills the Internet every day. In this regard, the protection of personal data is currently an important task. The first stage of many computer attacks is intelligence, and one of its mechanisms is port scanning, which allows an attacker to find out which services are running on the desired system. It means that in the future it can prepare and conduct an attack against the detected services and their vulnerabilities. This article provides an information and describes host detection methods. Keywords: host, scanning, Nmap ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP. Internet users pay little attention to the protection of personal data, and they are good prey for hackers. The first step to mastering information is to collect it. Nmap is one of the most common tools for scanning target hosts. This article analyses the methods of their detection. A host is a computer or other device that communicates with other hosts on a network. Hosts on a network include clients and servers that send or receive data, services, or applications [1]. One of the first tasks when investigating any network is to reduce the set of IP ranges to a list of active or interesting hosts. Network and port scanners are the most common tools for collecting information using technical methods. Host discovery methods [2]: ARP scanning is used to scan the local Ethernet network. On most LANs, especially those using the private address ranges provided by RFC 1918, the vast majority of IP addresses are not in use at any given time. When Nmap tries to send a raw IP packet, such as an ICMP echo request, the operating system must determine a hardware destination address (ARP) that matches the target IP address so that it can properly address the Ethernet frame. This requires it to send a series of ARP requests. UDP scanning has no concept of a connection and no equivalent of a TCP SYN packet. If a UDP packet is sent to a closed port, the system will respond with an ICMP port unreachable message. The absence of such a message is interpreted as a port opening signal. However, if the port is blocked by a firewall, the method will return a false response that the port is open. If ICMP port missing messages are blocked, all ports will be displayed open. Also, a limit on the frequency of ICMP packets can be set, which also affects the results given by the method. Ping scanning is a basic network scanning technique used when you want to know which hosts on the network are on. In terms of network scanning, there are the following types of ICMP messages [3]: Type Echo Ping. Echo request messages are also known as ping packets. A commonly used scanning tool is Nmap to perform ping checks and easily identify available hosts. Type Timestamp Ping. A timestamp request message requests system time information from the target host. The response is in decimal format and displays the number of milliseconds since midnight GMT. Type Address Mask Ping. The address mask query message shows the subnet mask used by the target host. This information is useful when mapping networks and determining the size of subnets and network spaces used by organizations. Security-conscious organizations firewalls often filter incoming ICMP messages, so ICMP inspection is not effective. However, ICMP is not filtered on most networks because ICMP messages are often useful for troubleshooting network problems. TCP SYN scanning is used by default. It can be launched quickly and is capable of scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast connection, without being hindered by restrictive firewalls. This type of scanning is non-intrusive and unnoticeable because the TCP connection is never fully established. It works with any TCP stack, regardless of any specific platform features. TCP scanning using the connect system call is the default TCP scanning type when SYN scanning is not available. It occurs when the user does not have privileges to use raw packets or when scanning IPv6 networks. Instead of using raw packets like most other types of scanning, Nmap \"asks\" the operating system to establish a connection to the target machine on a specified port via the connect system call. TCP ACK scanning is similar to TCP SYN scanning. The difference is that the TCP ACK flag is set instead of the SYN flag. Such an ACK packet claims to acknowledge data over an established TCP connection, but no such connection exists. Therefore, remote hosts must always respond with an RST packet, revealing their existence in the process. TCP NULL, FIN and Xmas scanning. Sometimes TCP SYN scanning is not sufficiently stealthy. Some firewalls and packet filters monitor SYN packets to protected ports. There are also programs like Synlogger and Courtney that can detect such scans. The advanced scans discussed here can pass through said obstacles undetected. The common idea of these methods is that closed ports should respond to “unintelligible” packets (packets with unexpected, incorrect, invalid character combinations) with RSTs, while open ports should simply ignore such packets. FIN scan uses “unexpected” FIN packets as a probe, “Xmas tree” scan uses packets with FIN, URG and PUSH flags, null scan uses packets without flags [4]. Some operating systems ignore the standard and send RSTs from open ports when they should simply skip (discard) the packet. Therefore, these types of scans will not work against such systems. IP protocol scanning. This type of scan allows you to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by the target machines. Technically, such scanning has ceased to be a type of port scanning, for which IP protocol numbers are cycled instead of TCP or UDP port numbers [5]. Although the - p option can be used here to select the protocol numbers to scan, the results are output in a port table format, and even use the same scanning engine as the various port scanning options. Figure 1 – Host discovery methods using the NMAP module Analysing the above, we can say that the main mechanism of intelligence is port scanning. It allows the attacker to find out which services are running on the target system and to prepare and conduct a targeted attack against the services and their vulnerabilities. The most common information gathering tools are network and port scanners. Among the well-known network scanning methods are:</td>\n",

It presents possible enhancements of message transmission protection by symmetric encryption creating image arrays using one-way math operations to mix public and private keys and a modified Diffie-Hellman method as a way to exchange private keys in an insecure channel. Keywords: images, Diffie–Hellman method, symmetric encryption, rgb. Nowadays the development of information systems and technologies, global computer systems and multimedia means, the question of ensuring the reliability and safety of data stored in digital form, as well as their reproduction and transmission through information communication channels is becoming more and more urgent and is getting more and more attention than ever. Even ordinary Internet users can become victims of an attack on their personal data or correspondence, as well as small and large companies. So, the focus of our work is on correspondence between users and its protection. One of the solutions that seems most promising is based on computer stenography, an encryption technique, the existence of which an average person is unaware of as there is no substantial evidence about such information or data. According to the basic principle of shorthand, a small amount of critical data is usually mixed with an array of information in such a way that an average user will not be interested in it. One of these arrays can be the most common available media files, e.g., audio, video and images. According to RAS research, about 1.13 trillion photos were taken in 2020 [1]. This means that if we divide this value by the number of people who have a phone or a camera, it will be about 211 photos per person. So, this conveys that most people already have a large number of unique photos in correspondence, which can be used as public keys. Furthermore, lots of people have personal messages that they have not published anywhere and have not forwarded, in case if there is none, then one can take their phone, take a photo and in a minute, they will have a unique private photo. These photos can act as a private key. At this stage, there may be doubts about the use of the symmetric method of encrypting future messages, as it is possible to use an asymmetric one. Still, we will consider the case when it is planned to exchange a large number of messages, and for this the symmetric model is for sure the favourite [2]. The model situation presupposes that you and your interlocutor have public keys and each of you has your own private key. The next step it to exchange private keys so that they are not declassified. The Diffie-Hellman method can be appropriate for this task, which is the use of a one-way mod operation with prime numbers. This method is based on the use of prime numbers for maximum security. So now we have a method of transferring two keys, but the question is raised how to move from theory to practice. The first proposal was to use prime numbers up to 256, that is, to generate a photo by choosing for each of the rgb colors a random prime number in the range from 0 to 255. But, firstly, there are only 53 of such numbers. Secondly, the remainder of dividing by some of them, such as 2 or 3, is too easy to calculate, so they should also be removed. This leads to the fact that out of these 53 at least a couple of numbers will remain, and an image with exactly the same color may raise suspicion even among average users. Therefore, there put forward a method of creating a table that contains 256 prime numbers in ascending order is. In this case you and your interlocutor are able to choose any open image, and even maybe more than one. Furthermore, this solution has a particular advantage as we do not have to take only prime numbers as in the first method, which will significantly increase possible variations, and as a consequence will increase the level of protection of the offered method. There is an example in which mixing means taking a pixel from an open image, separately adding the corresponding color from the rgb of the closed and open image according to the formula (𝑔𝑘mod n)mod 256, where n is a prime number from the table with the corresponding index, which is equal to the value of the base color in the open image, k is the value of the base color in closed + 1 (to avoid the 0 power), g is the product of the values from the table with indices equal to the other two values of the base colors in the open image. There is given an example of Alice and Bob to consider. If to put it briefly, Figure 1 demonstrates how it works, with the remark that instead of four colors, all pixels are presented in the image. That is, Bob takes and mixes his closed image with the open one, and gets the image that he will send to Alice. She, in her turn, performs the same operation and sends the public image mixed with her private key. Next, Bob mixes his closed image with what Alice sent him, and she in her turn performs the same action with what Bob sent to her. In this way, these two will receive the same images that they exchanged in an unsecured channel. That is, if an attacker intercepts all their messages, he will not receive the same image as these two. Figure 1 – Visual demonstration of Diffie–Hellman method work The use of this method will allow users to create a set of images that will be incomprehensible to an average user, later on using this set for symmetric encryption of messages in the future.</td>\n",

       "0   Abstract. A healthy lifestyle is a way of living that lower the risk of being ill or dying early. The article describes how the Internet of Things can improve everyday life, including nutrition and health monitoring. Keywords: Healthy Eating, nutrition, іnternet of Things, information technology, lifestyle INTRODUCTION Ukraine is among the top ten countries with the highest mortality risk from an unbalanced diet, according to a study by The Lancet magazine [1]. Among the main reasons are excessive sugar, salt, and meat consumption. According to WHO, 70% of a person's health depends on what he eats [2]. It has been scientifically proven that irrational nutrition significantly affects a person's life expectancy and leads to the emergence and development of non-infectious diseases: cardiovascular, diabetes, and metabolic disorders. A balanced diet is a unique tool that can strengthen human health, improve the body's adaptive capabilities and, most importantly, prevent the development of many diseases. In turn, the Internet of Things provides powerful tools to collect and process different data. Sensors and devices connected to Internet can be used for monitoring and improving our health and nutrition. Application for planning balanced nutrition Considering the above information, it is advisable to examine the possibility and prospects of developing an information system for planning balanced nutrition. The end product should help the end user to form a personal plan for a balanced diet and provide an opportunity to monitor his eating behavior in the form of statistics. With the help of this application, we want to offer ways to solve the problem of an unhealthy eating trends, such as insufficient information support, spending a lot of time on following a balanced diet, spending a lot of material resources on a balanced diet. It is essential to address these issues, as unhealthy eating is detrimental to our health and overall quality of life. The application should include the following modules: meal planning module: input and processing of personal data, an algorithm for forming a meal plan, planning purchases according to a meal plan; food diary module: logging of consumed products and dishes, reactions of the body to consumed food; food behavior statistics module: generation of reports based on the diary; communication module with specialists: the creation of appointments with specialists. Internet of Things Overview The Internet of Things is the concept of connecting any device (if it has an on/off switch) to the Internet and other connected devices. IoT represents a vast database in which intelligent sharing devices are known through sensors, electronics, system network, and hardware [3]. Communication between devices can occur between different physical objects, for example, in the office / home. Some examples of devices with IoT integration are lighting devices, smoke alarms, etc. Basically, devices that users can connect to any other device or via the Internet. Creating a personal eco-system of connected devices can allow us to bring many smart features into our everyday life. USING IOT FOR HEALTHY EATING The diagram shows an example of IoT eco-system that can be deployed for improving healthy eating [Figure 1]. Figure 1: IoT for Healthy Eating example As we can see from the figure, the following elements are involved in our future eco-system: User. A user is a person who will be the final consumer of the results that will be produced by the eco-system. The user is primarily interested in improving his nutrition. At the moment, he realizes that his diet is unbalanced and far from WHO recommendations. The user is worried about his health and is ready to start improving the quality of his life. However, he has very limited knowledge about balanced nutrition. Smart devices: Smart watches. Smartwatches have become an important device in our life. Heart monitors are included in wearable technologies and are used to measure heart rates. Smartwatches allow measuring spent calories. This could be helpful for people with diabetes, obesity, or other chronic diseases who comply with a specific diet advised by their care providers [4]. Smart scales. The smart scales can now connect to your smartphone and show you a collection of metrics from weight to body composition. Smart refrigerator. The Smart refrigerator not only stores food but also allows you to use the Internet, through which you can access hundreds of different recipes for cooking and even order food from online stores with home delivery. Smart cooking devices. All the functionality of the multicooker and even more will be available on your smartphone. From a distance, you can give commands: cook / do not cook (stew, fry, in general, start cooking), cook at a higher / lower temperature, end one program and switch to another, switch to the dish heating mode, and so on. Applications: Application for creating a personal plan for balanced nutrition. The application should help the end user to form a personal plan for a balanced diet, provide an opportunity to monitor his eating behavior in the form of statistics, and provide an opportunity to receive informational support from nutritionists [5]. Smart home application. Smart Home is an Android/IOS application that allows you to match your lifestyle and seamlessly control all aspects of your property, including lighting, climate, appliances, curtains and blinds, multi-room audio/video, security, digital video surveillance, entertainment and energy saving anywhere in the world. How this will work together. The first part. In real time, the smart watch will collect a certain overflow of parameters about the user, such as his heart rate, activity, the number of calories burned, trends inherent to the user during the day, sleep statistics, and others. These data will be transferred to the user's phone, and part of them will be used by the application for planning a balanced diet. Based on the received data, this application will determine the daily calorie needs of a given user and analyze the user's lifestyle and basic health parameters to take these indicators into account when planning a personalized diet[6]. Smart Scales not only measure weight but are also able to calculate the percentage of muscle mass in the body, measure fluids in the body, and the percentage of bone mass in the body. These indicators will be transmitted to the user's watch and phone. And again, they will be used by the application for planning a balanced diet. With this data, the application for creating personal plan for balanced nutrition can generate more accurate statistics and provide the best recommendations. A smart refrigerator and smart cooking devices are designed to simplify the process of preparing dishes that the application will recommend. Smart functions will help reduce the amount of time spent on cooking, preparing, and purchasing products. The second part. The second part of the user's interaction with the IoT eco-system begins with the moment when the user starts to follow the nutritious plan that the application suggested. According to the concept, the user should log the body's reaction to the nutrition plan. Then the application will start forming statistics, enriching it also with data from smart devices. Thus, we have a continuous interaction process between devices and the user. CONCLUSION In this article, we have described a personalized IoT eco-system that can provide the user with tools to manage and improve their diet. Using a smart watch, smart scales, smart refrigerator, smart devices for cooking, as well as appropriate applications, the user can easily monitor the main indicators of your health, get basic recommendations for healthy eating, follow a meal plan, record changes in the body depending on the food consumed, receive generated personalized nutrition and health statistics, improve and simplify life.   \n",

The research enables us to proceed to formalization of educational environment management processes. We will define the basic definition of this part of the research. Definition 1. By project-vector management of educational environments, we will understand the implementation of functions that ensure the organization, planning, and control of the distribution of available resources between the objects of educational environments and ensure their maximum rapid progress in the project-vector space. Mathematically, the multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments will reflect the vectors formed in the project-vector space (direction of change of objects), evaluate and adjust them based on the needs of stakeholders and project goals. The project-vector space contains a set of objects and subjects of the projects developing in time. The development of the objects and subjects of the projects corresponds to the movement in the project-vector space. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments will be carried out through the evaluation of the distance between the vectors reflecting the required and development of objects/subjects of projects. Mathematically, a set of vectors can represent the unit movements of project objects and subjects in the discrete project-vector space. Each vector coordinate represents the place of the object/subject of the project in one of the measurements at the current moment in time. The endpoint of these movements is the end of the project and the collapse of the project-vector space again (for the project that has ended) into a point. Each vector is defined by coordinates that reflect the state at some discrete point in time t of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk in the project space  : A( j ) ( t )  x(j) (t), x(j) (t),..., x(j) (t),..., x(j) (t), k\\t\\tk1\\tk2\\tki\\tkp\\t\\t(1) where x (j) (t) – the coordinate value of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk along the Ni axis in the project-vector space at time t. The motion vector determines the priority measurements (priority values of the project) and is defined through the magnitude of the change in the distance along the given directions per quantum of time. Building an effective project management system is not the \"aspirations\" of individual objects that matter but how similar or different their movement vectors are in the project-vector space. The same vectors mean that the movements of different project objects are equally predetermined. Therefore, a single system (or subsystem) of management of these projects can be created. In order to create an effective multisystem of project management, it is necessary to group projects in such a way that the distance between vectors of projects included in one group is minimal. The coordinates of the vectors in each measurement are as different as the attributes of the objects and subjects of the projects displayed in this measurement. It is necessary to develop a mathematical apparatus for calculating the distance between the directions of development of objects and the subjects of projects. This will make it possible to create optimal functional procedures for the formation of vectors and minimize the time and cost of creating a multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments. The mathematical apparatus of vector algebra is used to calculate the distances between vectors and determine the optimal set of groups of projects (and, respectively, the subsystems of the multisystem of project management). Assume that for some time interval dt the coordinate value of some object/subject Qj of the project Пk change from the value x(j) (t - dt), x(j) (t - dt),..., x(j) (t - dt),..., x(j) (t - dt) , to the value x(j) (t), x(j) (t),...,x(j) (t),...,x(j) (t) k1\\tk2\\tki kp\\t, где t − instant of time; dt – the time quantum of the discrete project-vector space. Then the value corresponding to the development of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk,can be determined from the formula l (j) (t)  k\\t, where l (j) (t) − the vector estimate of the change of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk at time t (instantaneous displacement velocity). However, there is one peculiarity in the design-vector space. In operations on vectors, the distance between them in some measurement is given by the difference of coordinates in that measurement. This cannot be used to calculate the degree of proximity of different vectors. Firstly, because the direction of the object/subject cannot be evaluated over small discrete time instants, it is necessary to evaluate them over a sufficiently long-time interval. Secondly, the creation of a single system (subsystem) of management of many projects is based not only on the \"unidirectional\" development of individual objects and subjects of projects but also on their proximity in the project-vector space. For example, whether the same methods or means of project management are used, the same performers, and whether the same input information is used. The two problems will be solved.   \n",

Many works are devoted to the problem of creating efficient algorithms for solving problems of high dimensionality, when the brute-force search methods become too time-consumin. This work is also devoted to the development of an efficient algorithm in the field of expert evaluation problems, namely, the algorithm for solving the problem of collective evaluation coordination. The main goal of this work is to implement in software the algorithm for the near search of the compromice median, which is sometimes called the GV-median. It is also necessary to investigate the program for performance at different values of input parameters. Keywords: expert evaluation, collective evaluation, coordination of individual expert evaluations, algorithm of near search of GV-median. Introduction. The problem of ordering a set of objects by the degree of manifestation of some properties is one of the most common problems of expert evaluation [1]. This class of problems formalizes a large number of practical problems in various subject areas. Since such problems are NP-hard, much attention is paid by researchers to the development and research of methods that significantly accelerate the finding of solutions to such problems. Usually, the acceleration of problem solutions is carried out due to the successful determination of the problem structure and the successful use of the features of the structure of admissible solutions. Features of nearest search problems. The classification of ranking problems is quite wide. Problems with the following parameters will be considered for the application of the GV-median nearest search algorithm: expert information about the relationship on the set of objects is used: from the expert committee; input information: individual expert assessments; metric for determining the distance between object ranks in the decision space: the module of differences between object ranks; class of relations between objects for which algorithms for finding a solution are built: strict rankings of objects; type of criterion of optimality of the optimization problem: minimax criterion. Software implementation. Python language was chosen for software implementation. One of the most influential disadvantages of Python is the speed of code execution, however, Python programs are usually written much faster due to the relative conciseness of the language and a wide range of libraries. In addition, using Python increases the readability of the code for other developers. Algorithm of the nearest search of the GV-median. The nearest search algorithm can be represented by a sequence of the following steps: Step 1. The input is k rankings of n objects that will be designated Ri , i  1,..., k, and represented as a matrix Ak, n. (1) Let us transform the matrix of object numbers Ak, n in individual rankings of the form (1) into the corresponding matrix of object ranks B k, n. Step 2. Calculate the distance matrix D k, k  between the rankings of the form by the rank mismatch metric using the formula n i\\tj\\ti\\tj l\\tl (2) where l 1 i denotes the rank of l object in the ranking of i expert Step 3. We look for the maxima along the rows of the matrix D(k,k), and among them we determine the minimum (or minima, if this value is not the only one). This minimum corresponds to the modified GV-median (also called the compromise median). The solution may not be unique. We track the row from which the GV-median was taken and look at the distances for which rankings were calculated in it. This ranking will be considered as a reference. Define the vector of ranks of the reference ranking as Ko  r0 ,..., r0 , and by Ro  a0 ,..., a0 , denote the order of objects in 1\\tn\\t1\\tn the reference ranking. Step 4. Around the reference ranking we look for the closest to it, that is, those that are at a distance of 2. Their number is exactly n 1 ranking. To do this, it is necessary to swap the neighboring elements in pairs and calculate the distance matrix and the modified GV-median for them. If the new median delivers a lower criterion value, it becomes the new reference. The ranking obtained in the end is the closest to the rankings set by the experts for the given criteria. Computational experiment. The tendency of increasing time consumption with increasing number of objects and experts is obvious. By conducting a computational experiment, we will determine the specific time required to solve problems of different dimensions. The computational experiment was conducted for variations of different parameters: with a fixed number of experts k  10 and a variable number of objects 4  n  50 , as well as with a fixed number of objects n  10 and a variable number of experts 4  k  50 . The results of the computational experiment are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Figure 1. Time in seconds to solve the problem with the number of experts 10 k  10 and the number of objects in the rankings from 4 to 50 4  n  50 With a fixed number of objects and a variable number of experts, it is expected that the dependence of the solution time on the number of experts is close to linear. Figure 2. Time in seconds to solve the problem for the number of objects in the rankings 10 n  10 and the number of experts from 4 to 50 4  k  50 It should be noted that the time complexity of the constructed algorithm for the nearest median search is O k 2n2  . The computational experiment also investigated the percentage of improvement of the result compared to the reference ranking. The results are presented in Figure 3. It is obvious that for a small number of experts k  10 the improvement reaches 30% on average. For a larger number of experts 10  k  50 the improvement reaches about 15%. At the same time, the improvement rate of the result when applying the genetic algorithm was only 3-5% [2], however, for a large number of objects n  500. Figure 3. Percentage of improvement of the result (criteria values at the GV- median) for the number of objects n  10 and the number of experts from 4 to 50 4  k  50 Conclusions. Humanity will not abandon the methods of solving the problems of collective coordination for a long time, because expert opinion is the only way to provide an assessment of objects, a full description of all the impacts on which is very complex and confusing. That is why the development and creation of new methods of working with expert assessments is necessary for more efficient use of available resources.   \n",

New malicious software fills the Internet every day. In this regard, the protection of personal data is currently an important task. The first stage of many computer attacks is intelligence, and one of its mechanisms is port scanning, which allows an attacker to find out which services are running on the desired system. It means that in the future it can prepare and conduct an attack against the detected services and their vulnerabilities. This article provides an information and describes host detection methods. Keywords: host, scanning, Nmap ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP. Internet users pay little attention to the protection of personal data, and they are good prey for hackers. The first step to mastering information is to collect it. Nmap is one of the most common tools for scanning target hosts. This article analyses the methods of their detection. A host is a computer or other device that communicates with other hosts on a network. Hosts on a network include clients and servers that send or receive data, services, or applications [1]. One of the first tasks when investigating any network is to reduce the set of IP ranges to a list of active or interesting hosts. Network and port scanners are the most common tools for collecting information using technical methods. Host discovery methods [2]: ARP scanning is used to scan the local Ethernet network. On most LANs, especially those using the private address ranges provided by RFC 1918, the vast majority of IP addresses are not in use at any given time. When Nmap tries to send a raw IP packet, such as an ICMP echo request, the operating system must determine a hardware destination address (ARP) that matches the target IP address so that it can properly address the Ethernet frame. This requires it to send a series of ARP requests. UDP scanning has no concept of a connection and no equivalent of a TCP SYN packet. If a UDP packet is sent to a closed port, the system will respond with an ICMP port unreachable message. The absence of such a message is interpreted as a port opening signal. However, if the port is blocked by a firewall, the method will return a false response that the port is open. If ICMP port missing messages are blocked, all ports will be displayed open. Also, a limit on the frequency of ICMP packets can be set, which also affects the results given by the method. Ping scanning is a basic network scanning technique used when you want to know which hosts on the network are on. In terms of network scanning, there are the following types of ICMP messages [3]: Type Echo Ping. Echo request messages are also known as ping packets. A commonly used scanning tool is Nmap to perform ping checks and easily identify available hosts. Type Timestamp Ping. A timestamp request message requests system time information from the target host. The response is in decimal format and displays the number of milliseconds since midnight GMT. Type Address Mask Ping. The address mask query message shows the subnet mask used by the target host. This information is useful when mapping networks and determining the size of subnets and network spaces used by organizations. Security-conscious organizations firewalls often filter incoming ICMP messages, so ICMP inspection is not effective. However, ICMP is not filtered on most networks because ICMP messages are often useful for troubleshooting network problems. TCP SYN scanning is used by default. It can be launched quickly and is capable of scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast connection, without being hindered by restrictive firewalls. This type of scanning is non-intrusive and unnoticeable because the TCP connection is never fully established. It works with any TCP stack, regardless of any specific platform features. TCP scanning using the connect system call is the default TCP scanning type when SYN scanning is not available. It occurs when the user does not have privileges to use raw packets or when scanning IPv6 networks. Instead of using raw packets like most other types of scanning, Nmap \"asks\" the operating system to establish a connection to the target machine on a specified port via the connect system call. TCP ACK scanning is similar to TCP SYN scanning. The difference is that the TCP ACK flag is set instead of the SYN flag. Such an ACK packet claims to acknowledge data over an established TCP connection, but no such connection exists. Therefore, remote hosts must always respond with an RST packet, revealing their existence in the process. TCP NULL, FIN and Xmas scanning. Sometimes TCP SYN scanning is not sufficiently stealthy. Some firewalls and packet filters monitor SYN packets to protected ports. There are also programs like Synlogger and Courtney that can detect such scans. The advanced scans discussed here can pass through said obstacles undetected. The common idea of these methods is that closed ports should respond to “unintelligible” packets (packets with unexpected, incorrect, invalid character combinations) with RSTs, while open ports should simply ignore such packets. FIN scan uses “unexpected” FIN packets as a probe, “Xmas tree” scan uses packets with FIN, URG and PUSH flags, null scan uses packets without flags [4]. Some operating systems ignore the standard and send RSTs from open ports when they should simply skip (discard) the packet. Therefore, these types of scans will not work against such systems. IP protocol scanning. This type of scan allows you to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by the target machines. Technically, such scanning has ceased to be a type of port scanning, for which IP protocol numbers are cycled instead of TCP or UDP port numbers [5]. Although the - p option can be used here to select the protocol numbers to scan, the results are output in a port table format, and even use the same scanning engine as the various port scanning options. Figure 1 – Host discovery methods using the NMAP module Analysing the above, we can say that the main mechanism of intelligence is port scanning. It allows the attacker to find out which services are running on the target system and to prepare and conduct a targeted attack against the services and their vulnerabilities. The most common information gathering tools are network and port scanners. Among the well-known network scanning methods are:   \n",

This work is devoted to the problem of message transmission protection in an unsecured communication channel. It presents possible enhancements of message transmission protection by symmetric encryption creating image arrays using one-way math operations to mix public and private keys and a modified Diffie-Hellman method as a way to exchange private keys in an insecure channel. Keywords: images, Diffie–Hellman method, symmetric encryption, rgb. Nowadays the development of information systems and technologies, global computer systems and multimedia means, the question of ensuring the reliability and safety of data stored in digital form, as well as their reproduction and transmission through information communication channels is becoming more and more urgent and is getting more and more attention than ever. Even ordinary Internet users can become victims of an attack on their personal data or correspondence, as well as small and large companies. So, the focus of our work is on correspondence between users and its protection. One of the solutions that seems most promising is based on computer stenography, an encryption technique, the existence of which an average person is unaware of as there is no substantial evidence about such information or data. According to the basic principle of shorthand, a small amount of critical data is usually mixed with an array of information in such a way that an average user will not be interested in it. One of these arrays can be the most common available media files, e.g., audio, video and images. According to RAS research, about 1.13 trillion photos were taken in 2020 [1]. This means that if we divide this value by the number of people who have a phone or a camera, it will be about 211 photos per person. So, this conveys that most people already have a large number of unique photos in correspondence, which can be used as public keys. Furthermore, lots of people have personal messages that they have not published anywhere and have not forwarded, in case if there is none, then one can take their phone, take a photo and in a minute, they will have a unique private photo. These photos can act as a private key. At this stage, there may be doubts about the use of the symmetric method of encrypting future messages, as it is possible to use an asymmetric one. Still, we will consider the case when it is planned to exchange a large number of messages, and for this the symmetric model is for sure the favourite [2]. The model situation presupposes that you and your interlocutor have public keys and each of you has your own private key. The next step it to exchange private keys so that they are not declassified. The Diffie-Hellman method can be appropriate for this task, which is the use of a one-way mod operation with prime numbers. This method is based on the use of prime numbers for maximum security. So now we have a method of transferring two keys, but the question is raised how to move from theory to practice. The first proposal was to use prime numbers up to 256, that is, to generate a photo by choosing for each of the rgb colors a random prime number in the range from 0 to 255. But, firstly, there are only 53 of such numbers. Secondly, the remainder of dividing by some of them, such as 2 or 3, is too easy to calculate, so they should also be removed. This leads to the fact that out of these 53 at least a couple of numbers will remain, and an image with exactly the same color may raise suspicion even among average users. Therefore, there put forward a method of creating a table that contains 256 prime numbers in ascending order is. In this case you and your interlocutor are able to choose any open image, and even maybe more than one. Furthermore, this solution has a particular advantage as we do not have to take only prime numbers as in the first method, which will significantly increase possible variations, and as a consequence will increase the level of protection of the offered method. There is an example in which mixing means taking a pixel from an open image, separately adding the corresponding color from the rgb of the closed and open image according to the formula (𝑔𝑘mod n)mod 256, where n is a prime number from the table with the corresponding index, which is equal to the value of the base color in the open image, k is the value of the base color in closed + 1 (to avoid the 0 power), g is the product of the values from the table with indices equal to the other two values of the base colors in the open image. There is given an example of Alice and Bob to consider. If to put it briefly, Figure 1 demonstrates how it works, with the remark that instead of four colors, all pixels are presented in the image. That is, Bob takes and mixes his closed image with the open one, and gets the image that he will send to Alice. She, in her turn, performs the same operation and sends the public image mixed with her private key. Next, Bob mixes his closed image with what Alice sent him, and she in her turn performs the same action with what Bob sent to her. In this way, these two will receive the same images that they exchanged in an unsecured channel. That is, if an attacker intercepts all their messages, he will not receive the same image as these two. Figure 1 – Visual demonstration of Diffie–Hellman method work The use of this method will allow users to create a set of images that will be incomprehensible to an average user, later on using this set for symmetric encryption of messages in the future.

       "      <td>Abstract. A healthy lifestyle is a way of living that lower the risk of being ill or dying early. The article describes how the Internet of Things can improve everyday life, including nutrition and health monitoring. Keywords: Healthy Eating, nutrition, іnternet of Things, information technology, lifestyle INTRODUCTION Ukraine is among the top ten countries with the highest mortality risk from an unbalanced diet, according to a study by The Lancet magazine [1]. Among the main reasons are excessive sugar, salt, and meat consumption. According to WHO, 70% of a person's health depends on what he eats [2]. It has been scientifically proven that irrational nutrition significantly affects a person's life expectancy and leads to the emergence and development of non-infectious diseases: cardiovascular, diabetes, and metabolic disorders. A balanced diet is a unique tool that can strengthen human health, improve the body's adaptive capabilities and, most importantly, prevent the development of many diseases. In turn, the Internet of Things provides powerful tools to collect and process different data. Sensors and devices connected to Internet can be used for monitoring and improving our health and nutrition. Application for planning balanced nutrition Considering the above information, it is advisable to examine the possibility and prospects of developing an information system for planning balanced nutrition. The end product should help the end user to form a personal plan for a balanced diet and provide an opportunity to monitor his eating behavior in the form of statistics. With the help of this application, we want to offer ways to solve the problem of an unhealthy eating trends, such as insufficient information support, spending a lot of time on following a balanced diet, spending a lot of material resources on a balanced diet. It is essential to address these issues, as unhealthy eating is detrimental to our health and overall quality of life. The application should include the following modules: meal planning module: input and processing of personal data, an algorithm for forming a meal plan, planning purchases according to a meal plan; food diary module: logging of consumed products and dishes, reactions of the body to consumed food; food behavior statistics module: generation of reports based on the diary; communication module with specialists: the creation of appointments with specialists. Internet of Things Overview The Internet of Things is the concept of connecting any device (if it has an on/off switch) to the Internet and other connected devices. IoT represents a vast database in which intelligent sharing devices are known through sensors, electronics, system network, and hardware [3]. Communication between devices can occur between different physical objects, for example, in the office / home. Some examples of devices with IoT integration are lighting devices, smoke alarms, etc. Basically, devices that users can connect to any other device or via the Internet. Creating a personal eco-system of connected devices can allow us to bring many smart features into our everyday life. USING IOT FOR HEALTHY EATING The diagram shows an example of IoT eco-system that can be deployed for improving healthy eating [Figure 1]. Figure 1: IoT for Healthy Eating example As we can see from the figure, the following elements are involved in our future eco-system: User. A user is a person who will be the final consumer of the results that will be produced by the eco-system. The user is primarily interested in improving his nutrition. At the moment, he realizes that his diet is unbalanced and far from WHO recommendations. The user is worried about his health and is ready to start improving the quality of his life. However, he has very limited knowledge about balanced nutrition. Smart devices: Smart watches. Smartwatches have become an important device in our life. Heart monitors are included in wearable technologies and are used to measure heart rates. Smartwatches allow measuring spent calories. This could be helpful for people with diabetes, obesity, or other chronic diseases who comply with a specific diet advised by their care providers [4]. Smart scales. The smart scales can now connect to your smartphone and show you a collection of metrics from weight to body composition. Smart refrigerator. The Smart refrigerator not only stores food but also allows you to use the Internet, through which you can access hundreds of different recipes for cooking and even order food from online stores with home delivery. Smart cooking devices. All the functionality of the multicooker and even more will be available on your smartphone. From a distance, you can give commands: cook / do not cook (stew, fry, in general, start cooking), cook at a higher / lower temperature, end one program and switch to another, switch to the dish heating mode, and so on. Applications: Application for creating a personal plan for balanced nutrition. The application should help the end user to form a personal plan for a balanced diet, provide an opportunity to monitor his eating behavior in the form of statistics, and provide an opportunity to receive informational support from nutritionists [5]. Smart home application. Smart Home is an Android/IOS application that allows you to match your lifestyle and seamlessly control all aspects of your property, including lighting, climate, appliances, curtains and blinds, multi-room audio/video, security, digital video surveillance, entertainment and energy saving anywhere in the world. How this will work together. The first part. In real time, the smart watch will collect a certain overflow of parameters about the user, such as his heart rate, activity, the number of calories burned, trends inherent to the user during the day, sleep statistics, and others. These data will be transferred to the user's phone, and part of them will be used by the application for planning a balanced diet. Based on the received data, this application will determine the daily calorie needs of a given user and analyze the user's lifestyle and basic health parameters to take these indicators into account when planning a personalized diet[6]. Smart Scales not only measure weight but are also able to calculate the percentage of muscle mass in the body, measure fluids in the body, and the percentage of bone mass in the body. These indicators will be transmitted to the user's watch and phone. And again, they will be used by the application for planning a balanced diet. With this data, the application for creating personal plan for balanced nutrition can generate more accurate statistics and provide the best recommendations. A smart refrigerator and smart cooking devices are designed to simplify the process of preparing dishes that the application will recommend. Smart functions will help reduce the amount of time spent on cooking, preparing, and purchasing products. The second part. The second part of the user's interaction with the IoT eco-system begins with the moment when the user starts to follow the nutritious plan that the application suggested. According to the concept, the user should log the body's reaction to the nutrition plan. Then the application will start forming statistics, enriching it also with data from smart devices. Thus, we have a continuous interaction process between devices and the user. CONCLUSION In this article, we have described a personalized IoT eco-system that can provide the user with tools to manage and improve their diet. Using a smart watch, smart scales, smart refrigerator, smart devices for cooking, as well as appropriate applications, the user can easily monitor the main indicators of your health, get basic recommendations for healthy eating, follow a meal plan, record changes in the body depending on the food consumed, receive generated personalized nutrition and health statistics, improve and simplify life.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As a result of the decomposition of the subject area, the classification of projects of educational environments is made, and the task of optimal management in the design-vector space is formulated. The research enables us to proceed to formalization of educational environment management processes. We will define the basic definition of this part of the research. Definition 1. By project-vector management of educational environments, we will understand the implementation of functions that ensure the organization, planning, and control of the distribution of available resources between the objects of educational environments and ensure their maximum rapid progress in the project-vector space. Mathematically, the multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments will reflect the vectors formed in the project-vector space (direction of change of objects), evaluate and adjust them based on the needs of stakeholders and project goals. The project-vector space contains a set of objects and subjects of the projects developing in time. The development of the objects and subjects of the projects corresponds to the movement in the project-vector space. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments will be carried out through the evaluation of the distance between the vectors reflecting the required and development of objects/subjects of projects. Mathematically, a set of vectors can represent the unit movements of project objects and subjects in the discrete project-vector space. Each vector coordinate represents the place of the object/subject of the project in one of the measurements at the current moment in time. The endpoint of these movements is the end of the project and the collapse of the project-vector space again (for the project that has ended) into a point. Each vector is defined by coordinates that reflect the state at some discrete point in time t of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk in the project space  : A( j ) ( t )  x(j) (t), x(j) (t),..., x(j) (t),..., x(j) (t), k\\t\\tk1\\tk2\\tki\\tkp\\t\\t(1) where x (j) (t) – the coordinate value of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk along the Ni axis in the project-vector space at time t. The motion vector determines the priority measurements (priority values of the project) and is defined through the magnitude of the change in the distance along the given directions per quantum of time. Building an effective project management system is not the \"aspirations\" of individual objects that matter but how similar or different their movement vectors are in the project-vector space. The same vectors mean that the movements of different project objects are equally predetermined. Therefore, a single system (or subsystem) of management of these projects can be created. In order to create an effective multisystem of project management, it is necessary to group projects in such a way that the distance between vectors of projects included in one group is minimal. The coordinates of the vectors in each measurement are as different as the attributes of the objects and subjects of the projects displayed in this measurement. It is necessary to develop a mathematical apparatus for calculating the distance between the directions of development of objects and the subjects of projects. This will make it possible to create optimal functional procedures for the formation of vectors and minimize the time and cost of creating a multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments. The mathematical apparatus of vector algebra is used to calculate the distances between vectors and determine the optimal set of groups of projects (and, respectively, the subsystems of the multisystem of project management). Assume that for some time interval dt the coordinate value of some object/subject Qj of the project Пk change from the value x(j) (t - dt), x(j) (t - dt),..., x(j) (t - dt),..., x(j) (t - dt) , to the value x(j) (t), x(j) (t),...,x(j) (t),...,x(j) (t) k1\\tk2\\tki kp\\t, где t − instant of time; dt – the time quantum of the discrete project-vector space. Then the value corresponding to the development of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk,can be determined from the formula l (j) (t)  k\\t, where l (j) (t) − the vector estimate of the change of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk at time t (instantaneous displacement velocity). However, there is one peculiarity in the design-vector space. In operations on vectors, the distance between them in some measurement is given by the difference of coordinates in that measurement. This cannot be used to calculate the degree of proximity of different vectors. Firstly, because the direction of the object/subject cannot be evaluated over small discrete time instants, it is necessary to evaluate them over a sufficiently long-time interval. Secondly, the creation of a single system (subsystem) of management of many projects is based not only on the \"unidirectional\" development of individual objects and subjects of projects but also on their proximity in the project-vector space. For example, whether the same methods or means of project management are used, the same performers, and whether the same input information is used. The two problems will be solved.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract. Many works are devoted to the problem of creating efficient algorithms for solving problems of high dimensionality, when the brute-force search methods become too time-consumin. This work is also devoted to the development of an efficient algorithm in the field of expert evaluation problems, namely, the algorithm for solving the problem of collective evaluation coordination. The main goal of this work is to implement in software the algorithm for the near search of the compromice median, which is sometimes called the GV-median. It is also necessary to investigate the program for performance at different values of input parameters. Keywords: expert evaluation, collective evaluation, coordination of individual expert evaluations, algorithm of near search of GV-median. Introduction. The problem of ordering a set of objects by the degree of manifestation of some properties is one of the most common problems of expert evaluation [1]. This class of problems formalizes a large number of practical problems in various subject areas. Since such problems are NP-hard, much attention is paid by researchers to the development and research of methods that significantly accelerate the finding of solutions to such problems. Usually, the acceleration of problem solutions is carried out due to the successful determination of the problem structure and the successful use of the features of the structure of admissible solutions. Features of nearest search problems. The classification of ranking problems is quite wide. Problems with the following parameters will be considered for the application of the GV-median nearest search algorithm: expert information about the relationship on the set of objects is used: from the expert committee; input information: individual expert assessments; metric for determining the distance between object ranks in the decision space: the module of differences between object ranks; class of relations between objects for which algorithms for finding a solution are built: strict rankings of objects; type of criterion of optimality of the optimization problem: minimax criterion. Software implementation. Python language was chosen for software implementation. One of the most influential disadvantages of Python is the speed of code execution, however, Python programs are usually written much faster due to the relative conciseness of the language and a wide range of libraries. In addition, using Python increases the readability of the code for other developers. Algorithm of the nearest search of the GV-median. The nearest search algorithm can be represented by a sequence of the following steps: Step 1. The input is k rankings of n objects that will be designated Ri , i  1,..., k, and represented as a matrix Ak, n. (1) Let us transform the matrix of object numbers Ak, n in individual rankings of the form (1) into the corresponding matrix of object ranks B k, n. Step 2. Calculate the distance matrix D k, k  between the rankings of the form by the rank mismatch metric using the formula n i\\tj\\ti\\tj l\\tl (2) where l 1 i denotes the rank of l object in the ranking of i expert Step 3. We look for the maxima along the rows of the matrix D(k,k), and among them we determine the minimum (or minima, if this value is not the only one). This minimum corresponds to the modified GV-median (also called the compromise median). The solution may not be unique. We track the row from which the GV-median was taken and look at the distances for which rankings were calculated in it. This ranking will be considered as a reference. Define the vector of ranks of the reference ranking as Ko  r0 ,..., r0 , and by Ro  a0 ,..., a0 , denote the order of objects in 1\\tn\\t1\\tn the reference ranking. Step 4. Around the reference ranking we look for the closest to it, that is, those that are at a distance of 2. Their number is exactly n 1 ranking. To do this, it is necessary to swap the neighboring elements in pairs and calculate the distance matrix and the modified GV-median for them. If the new median delivers a lower criterion value, it becomes the new reference. The ranking obtained in the end is the closest to the rankings set by the experts for the given criteria. Computational experiment. The tendency of increasing time consumption with increasing number of objects and experts is obvious. By conducting a computational experiment, we will determine the specific time required to solve problems of different dimensions. The computational experiment was conducted for variations of different parameters: with a fixed number of experts k  10 and a variable number of objects 4  n  50 , as well as with a fixed number of objects n  10 and a variable number of experts 4  k  50 . The results of the computational experiment are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Figure 1. Time in seconds to solve the problem with the number of experts 10 k  10 and the number of objects in the rankings from 4 to 50 4  n  50 With a fixed number of objects and a variable number of experts, it is expected that the dependence of the solution time on the number of experts is close to linear. Figure 2. Time in seconds to solve the problem for the number of objects in the rankings 10 n  10 and the number of experts from 4 to 50 4  k  50 It should be noted that the time complexity of the constructed algorithm for the nearest median search is O k 2n2  . The computational experiment also investigated the percentage of improvement of the result compared to the reference ranking. The results are presented in Figure 3. It is obvious that for a small number of experts k  10 the improvement reaches 30% on average. For a larger number of experts 10  k  50 the improvement reaches about 15%. At the same time, the improvement rate of the result when applying the genetic algorithm was only 3-5% [2], however, for a large number of objects n  500. Figure 3. Percentage of improvement of the result (criteria values at the GV- median) for the number of objects n  10 and the number of experts from 4 to 50 4  k  50 Conclusions. Humanity will not abandon the methods of solving the problems of collective coordination for a long time, because expert opinion is the only way to provide an assessment of objects, a full description of all the impacts on which is very complex and confusing. That is why the development and creation of new methods of working with expert assessments is necessary for more efficient use of available resources.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract. New malicious software fills the Internet every day. In this regard, the protection of personal data is currently an important task. The first stage of many computer attacks is intelligence, and one of its mechanisms is port scanning, which allows an attacker to find out which services are running on the desired system. It means that in the future it can prepare and conduct an attack against the detected services and their vulnerabilities. This article provides an information and describes host detection methods. Keywords: host, scanning, Nmap ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP. Internet users pay little attention to the protection of personal data, and they are good prey for hackers. The first step to mastering information is to collect it. Nmap is one of the most common tools for scanning target hosts. This article analyses the methods of their detection. A host is a computer or other device that communicates with other hosts on a network. Hosts on a network include clients and servers that send or receive data, services, or applications [1]. One of the first tasks when investigating any network is to reduce the set of IP ranges to a list of active or interesting hosts. Network and port scanners are the most common tools for collecting information using technical methods. Host discovery methods [2]: ARP scanning is used to scan the local Ethernet network. On most LANs, especially those using the private address ranges provided by RFC 1918, the vast majority of IP addresses are not in use at any given time. When Nmap tries to send a raw IP packet, such as an ICMP echo request, the operating system must determine a hardware destination address (ARP) that matches the target IP address so that it can properly address the Ethernet frame. This requires it to send a series of ARP requests. UDP scanning has no concept of a connection and no equivalent of a TCP SYN packet. If a UDP packet is sent to a closed port, the system will respond with an ICMP port unreachable message. The absence of such a message is interpreted as a port opening signal. However, if the port is blocked by a firewall, the method will return a false response that the port is open. If ICMP port missing messages are blocked, all ports will be displayed open. Also, a limit on the frequency of ICMP packets can be set, which also affects the results given by the method. Ping scanning is a basic network scanning technique used when you want to know which hosts on the network are on. In terms of network scanning, there are the following types of ICMP messages [3]: Type Echo Ping. Echo request messages are also known as ping packets. A commonly used scanning tool is Nmap to perform ping checks and easily identify available hosts. Type Timestamp Ping. A timestamp request message requests system time information from the target host. The response is in decimal format and displays the number of milliseconds since midnight GMT. Type Address Mask Ping. The address mask query message shows the subnet mask used by the target host. This information is useful when mapping networks and determining the size of subnets and network spaces used by organizations. Security-conscious organizations firewalls often filter incoming ICMP messages, so ICMP inspection is not effective. However, ICMP is not filtered on most networks because ICMP messages are often useful for troubleshooting network problems. TCP SYN scanning is used by default. It can be launched quickly and is capable of scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast connection, without being hindered by restrictive firewalls. This type of scanning is non-intrusive and unnoticeable because the TCP connection is never fully established. It works with any TCP stack, regardless of any specific platform features. TCP scanning using the connect system call is the default TCP scanning type when SYN scanning is not available. It occurs when the user does not have privileges to use raw packets or when scanning IPv6 networks. Instead of using raw packets like most other types of scanning, Nmap \"asks\" the operating system to establish a connection to the target machine on a specified port via the connect system call. TCP ACK scanning is similar to TCP SYN scanning. The difference is that the TCP ACK flag is set instead of the SYN flag. Such an ACK packet claims to acknowledge data over an established TCP connection, but no such connection exists. Therefore, remote hosts must always respond with an RST packet, revealing their existence in the process. TCP NULL, FIN and Xmas scanning. Sometimes TCP SYN scanning is not sufficiently stealthy. Some firewalls and packet filters monitor SYN packets to protected ports. There are also programs like Synlogger and Courtney that can detect such scans. The advanced scans discussed here can pass through said obstacles undetected. The common idea of these methods is that closed ports should respond to “unintelligible” packets (packets with unexpected, incorrect, invalid character combinations) with RSTs, while open ports should simply ignore such packets. FIN scan uses “unexpected” FIN packets as a probe, “Xmas tree” scan uses packets with FIN, URG and PUSH flags, null scan uses packets without flags [4]. Some operating systems ignore the standard and send RSTs from open ports when they should simply skip (discard) the packet. Therefore, these types of scans will not work against such systems. IP protocol scanning. This type of scan allows you to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by the target machines. Technically, such scanning has ceased to be a type of port scanning, for which IP protocol numbers are cycled instead of TCP or UDP port numbers [5]. Although the - p option can be used here to select the protocol numbers to scan, the results are output in a port table format, and even use the same scanning engine as the various port scanning options. Figure 1 – Host discovery methods using the NMAP module Analysing the above, we can say that the main mechanism of intelligence is port scanning. It allows the attacker to find out which services are running on the target system and to prepare and conduct a targeted attack against the services and their vulnerabilities. The most common information gathering tools are network and port scanners. Among the well-known network scanning methods are:</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract. This work is devoted to the problem of message transmission protection in an unsecured communication channel. It presents possible enhancements of message transmission protection by symmetric encryption creating image arrays using one-way math operations to mix public and private keys and a modified Diffie-Hellman method as a way to exchange private keys in an insecure channel. Keywords: images, Diffie–Hellman method, symmetric encryption, rgb. Nowadays the development of information systems and technologies, global computer systems and multimedia means, the question of ensuring the reliability and safety of data stored in digital form, as well as their reproduction and transmission through information communication channels is becoming more and more urgent and is getting more and more attention than ever. Even ordinary Internet users can become victims of an attack on their personal data or correspondence, as well as small and large companies. So, the focus of our work is on correspondence between users and its protection. One of the solutions that seems most promising is based on computer stenography, an encryption technique, the existence of which an average person is unaware of as there is no substantial evidence about such information or data. According to the basic principle of shorthand, a small amount of critical data is usually mixed with an array of information in such a way that an average user will not be interested in it. One of these arrays can be the most common available media files, e.g., audio, video and images. According to RAS research, about 1.13 trillion photos were taken in 2020 [1]. This means that if we divide this value by the number of people who have a phone or a camera, it will be about 211 photos per person. So, this conveys that most people already have a large number of unique photos in correspondence, which can be used as public keys. Furthermore, lots of people have personal messages that they have not published anywhere and have not forwarded, in case if there is none, then one can take their phone, take a photo and in a minute, they will have a unique private photo. These photos can act as a private key. At this stage, there may be doubts about the use of the symmetric method of encrypting future messages, as it is possible to use an asymmetric one. Still, we will consider the case when it is planned to exchange a large number of messages, and for this the symmetric model is for sure the favourite [2]. The model situation presupposes that you and your interlocutor have public keys and each of you has your own private key. The next step it to exchange private keys so that they are not declassified. The Diffie-Hellman method can be appropriate for this task, which is the use of a one-way mod operation with prime numbers. This method is based on the use of prime numbers for maximum security. So now we have a method of transferring two keys, but the question is raised how to move from theory to practice. The first proposal was to use prime numbers up to 256, that is, to generate a photo by choosing for each of the rgb colors a random prime number in the range from 0 to 255. But, firstly, there are only 53 of such numbers. Secondly, the remainder of dividing by some of them, such as 2 or 3, is too easy to calculate, so they should also be removed. This leads to the fact that out of these 53 at least a couple of numbers will remain, and an image with exactly the same color may raise suspicion even among average users. Therefore, there put forward a method of creating a table that contains 256 prime numbers in ascending order is. In this case you and your interlocutor are able to choose any open image, and even maybe more than one. Furthermore, this solution has a particular advantage as we do not have to take only prime numbers as in the first method, which will significantly increase possible variations, and as a consequence will increase the level of protection of the offered method. There is an example in which mixing means taking a pixel from an open image, separately adding the corresponding color from the rgb of the closed and open image according to the formula (𝑔𝑘mod n)mod 256, where n is a prime number from the table with the corresponding index, which is equal to the value of the base color in the open image, k is the value of the base color in closed + 1 (to avoid the 0 power), g is the product of the values from the table with indices equal to the other two values of the base colors in the open image. There is given an example of Alice and Bob to consider. If to put it briefly, Figure 1 demonstrates how it works, with the remark that instead of four colors, all pixels are presented in the image. That is, Bob takes and mixes his closed image with the open one, and gets the image that he will send to Alice. She, in her turn, performs the same operation and sends the public image mixed with her private key. Next, Bob mixes his closed image with what Alice sent him, and she in her turn performs the same action with what Bob sent to her. In this way, these two will receive the same images that they exchanged in an unsecured channel. That is, if an attacker intercepts all their messages, he will not receive the same image as these two. Figure 1 – Visual demonstration of Diffie–Hellman method work The use of this method will allow users to create a set of images that will be incomprehensible to an average user, later on using this set for symmetric encryption of messages in the future.</td>\n",

       "0   Abstract. A healthy lifestyle is a way of living that lower the risk of being ill or dying early. The article describes how the Internet of Things can improve everyday life, including nutrition and health monitoring. Keywords: Healthy Eating, nutrition, іnternet of Things, information technology, lifestyle INTRODUCTION Ukraine is among the top ten countries with the highest mortality risk from an unbalanced diet, according to a study by The Lancet magazine [1]. Among the main reasons are excessive sugar, salt, and meat consumption. According to WHO, 70% of a person's health depends on what he eats [2]. It has been scientifically proven that irrational nutrition significantly affects a person's life expectancy and leads to the emergence and development of non-infectious diseases: cardiovascular, diabetes, and metabolic disorders. A balanced diet is a unique tool that can strengthen human health, improve the body's adaptive capabilities and, most importantly, prevent the development of many diseases. In turn, the Internet of Things provides powerful tools to collect and process different data. Sensors and devices connected to Internet can be used for monitoring and improving our health and nutrition. Application for planning balanced nutrition Considering the above information, it is advisable to examine the possibility and prospects of developing an information system for planning balanced nutrition. The end product should help the end user to form a personal plan for a balanced diet and provide an opportunity to monitor his eating behavior in the form of statistics. With the help of this application, we want to offer ways to solve the problem of an unhealthy eating trends, such as insufficient information support, spending a lot of time on following a balanced diet, spending a lot of material resources on a balanced diet. It is essential to address these issues, as unhealthy eating is detrimental to our health and overall quality of life. The application should include the following modules: meal planning module: input and processing of personal data, an algorithm for forming a meal plan, planning purchases according to a meal plan; food diary module: logging of consumed products and dishes, reactions of the body to consumed food; food behavior statistics module: generation of reports based on the diary; communication module with specialists: the creation of appointments with specialists. Internet of Things Overview The Internet of Things is the concept of connecting any device (if it has an on/off switch) to the Internet and other connected devices. IoT represents a vast database in which intelligent sharing devices are known through sensors, electronics, system network, and hardware [3]. Communication between devices can occur between different physical objects, for example, in the office / home. Some examples of devices with IoT integration are lighting devices, smoke alarms, etc. Basically, devices that users can connect to any other device or via the Internet. Creating a personal eco-system of connected devices can allow us to bring many smart features into our everyday life. USING IOT FOR HEALTHY EATING The diagram shows an example of IoT eco-system that can be deployed for improving healthy eating [Figure 1]. Figure 1: IoT for Healthy Eating example As we can see from the figure, the following elements are involved in our future eco-system: User. A user is a person who will be the final consumer of the results that will be produced by the eco-system. The user is primarily interested in improving his nutrition. At the moment, he realizes that his diet is unbalanced and far from WHO recommendations. The user is worried about his health and is ready to start improving the quality of his life. However, he has very limited knowledge about balanced nutrition. Smart devices: Smart watches. Smartwatches have become an important device in our life. Heart monitors are included in wearable technologies and are used to measure heart rates. Smartwatches allow measuring spent calories. This could be helpful for people with diabetes, obesity, or other chronic diseases who comply with a specific diet advised by their care providers [4]. Smart scales. The smart scales can now connect to your smartphone and show you a collection of metrics from weight to body composition. Smart refrigerator. The Smart refrigerator not only stores food but also allows you to use the Internet, through which you can access hundreds of different recipes for cooking and even order food from online stores with home delivery. Smart cooking devices. All the functionality of the multicooker and even more will be available on your smartphone. From a distance, you can give commands: cook / do not cook (stew, fry, in general, start cooking), cook at a higher / lower temperature, end one program and switch to another, switch to the dish heating mode, and so on. Applications: Application for creating a personal plan for balanced nutrition. The application should help the end user to form a personal plan for a balanced diet, provide an opportunity to monitor his eating behavior in the form of statistics, and provide an opportunity to receive informational support from nutritionists [5]. Smart home application. Smart Home is an Android/IOS application that allows you to match your lifestyle and seamlessly control all aspects of your property, including lighting, climate, appliances, curtains and blinds, multi-room audio/video, security, digital video surveillance, entertainment and energy saving anywhere in the world. How this will work together. The first part. In real time, the smart watch will collect a certain overflow of parameters about the user, such as his heart rate, activity, the number of calories burned, trends inherent to the user during the day, sleep statistics, and others. These data will be transferred to the user's phone, and part of them will be used by the application for planning a balanced diet. Based on the received data, this application will determine the daily calorie needs of a given user and analyze the user's lifestyle and basic health parameters to take these indicators into account when planning a personalized diet[6]. Smart Scales not only measure weight but are also able to calculate the percentage of muscle mass in the body, measure fluids in the body, and the percentage of bone mass in the body. These indicators will be transmitted to the user's watch and phone. And again, they will be used by the application for planning a balanced diet. With this data, the application for creating personal plan for balanced nutrition can generate more accurate statistics and provide the best recommendations. A smart refrigerator and smart cooking devices are designed to simplify the process of preparing dishes that the application will recommend. Smart functions will help reduce the amount of time spent on cooking, preparing, and purchasing products. The second part. The second part of the user's interaction with the IoT eco-system begins with the moment when the user starts to follow the nutritious plan that the application suggested. According to the concept, the user should log the body's reaction to the nutrition plan. Then the application will start forming statistics, enriching it also with data from smart devices. Thus, we have a continuous interaction process between devices and the user. CONCLUSION In this article, we have described a personalized IoT eco-system that can provide the user with tools to manage and improve their diet. Using a smart watch, smart scales, smart refrigerator, smart devices for cooking, as well as appropriate applications, the user can easily monitor the main indicators of your health, get basic recommendations for healthy eating, follow a meal plan, record changes in the body depending on the food consumed, receive generated personalized nutrition and health statistics, improve and simplify life.    \n",

The research enables us to proceed to formalization of educational environment management processes. We will define the basic definition of this part of the research. Definition 1. By project-vector management of educational environments, we will understand the implementation of functions that ensure the organization, planning, and control of the distribution of available resources between the objects of educational environments and ensure their maximum rapid progress in the project-vector space. Mathematically, the multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments will reflect the vectors formed in the project-vector space (direction of change of objects), evaluate and adjust them based on the needs of stakeholders and project goals. The project-vector space contains a set of objects and subjects of the projects developing in time. The development of the objects and subjects of the projects corresponds to the movement in the project-vector space. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments will be carried out through the evaluation of the distance between the vectors reflecting the required and development of objects/subjects of projects. Mathematically, a set of vectors can represent the unit movements of project objects and subjects in the discrete project-vector space. Each vector coordinate represents the place of the object/subject of the project in one of the measurements at the current moment in time. The endpoint of these movements is the end of the project and the collapse of the project-vector space again (for the project that has ended) into a point. Each vector is defined by coordinates that reflect the state at some discrete point in time t of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk in the project space  : A( j ) ( t )  x(j) (t), x(j) (t),..., x(j) (t),..., x(j) (t), k\\t\\tk1\\tk2\\tki\\tkp\\t\\t(1) where x (j) (t) – the coordinate value of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk along the Ni axis in the project-vector space at time t. The motion vector determines the priority measurements (priority values of the project) and is defined through the magnitude of the change in the distance along the given directions per quantum of time. Building an effective project management system is not the \"aspirations\" of individual objects that matter but how similar or different their movement vectors are in the project-vector space. The same vectors mean that the movements of different project objects are equally predetermined. Therefore, a single system (or subsystem) of management of these projects can be created. In order to create an effective multisystem of project management, it is necessary to group projects in such a way that the distance between vectors of projects included in one group is minimal. The coordinates of the vectors in each measurement are as different as the attributes of the objects and subjects of the projects displayed in this measurement. It is necessary to develop a mathematical apparatus for calculating the distance between the directions of development of objects and the subjects of projects. This will make it possible to create optimal functional procedures for the formation of vectors and minimize the time and cost of creating a multisystem of project-vector management of educational environments. The mathematical apparatus of vector algebra is used to calculate the distances between vectors and determine the optimal set of groups of projects (and, respectively, the subsystems of the multisystem of project management). Assume that for some time interval dt the coordinate value of some object/subject Qj of the project Пk change from the value x(j) (t - dt), x(j) (t - dt),..., x(j) (t - dt),..., x(j) (t - dt) , to the value x(j) (t), x(j) (t),...,x(j) (t),...,x(j) (t) k1\\tk2\\tki kp\\t, где t − instant of time; dt – the time quantum of the discrete project-vector space. Then the value corresponding to the development of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk,can be determined from the formula l (j) (t)  k\\t, where l (j) (t) − the vector estimate of the change of the object/subject Qj of the project Пk at time t (instantaneous displacement velocity). However, there is one peculiarity in the design-vector space. In operations on vectors, the distance between them in some measurement is given by the difference of coordinates in that measurement. This cannot be used to calculate the degree of proximity of different vectors. Firstly, because the direction of the object/subject cannot be evaluated over small discrete time instants, it is necessary to evaluate them over a sufficiently long-time interval. Secondly, the creation of a single system (subsystem) of management of many projects is based not only on the \"unidirectional\" development of individual objects and subjects of projects but also on their proximity in the project-vector space. For example, whether the same methods or means of project management are used, the same performers, and whether the same input information is used. The two problems will be solved.    \n",

Many works are devoted to the problem of creating efficient algorithms for solving problems of high dimensionality, when the brute-force search methods become too time-consumin. This work is also devoted to the development of an efficient algorithm in the field of expert evaluation problems, namely, the algorithm for solving the problem of collective evaluation coordination. The main goal of this work is to implement in software the algorithm for the near search of the compromice median, which is sometimes called the GV-median. It is also necessary to investigate the program for performance at different values of input parameters. Keywords: expert evaluation, collective evaluation, coordination of individual expert evaluations, algorithm of near search of GV-median. Introduction. The problem of ordering a set of objects by the degree of manifestation of some properties is one of the most common problems of expert evaluation [1]. This class of problems formalizes a large number of practical problems in various subject areas. Since such problems are NP-hard, much attention is paid by researchers to the development and research of methods that significantly accelerate the finding of solutions to such problems. Usually, the acceleration of problem solutions is carried out due to the successful determination of the problem structure and the successful use of the features of the structure of admissible solutions. Features of nearest search problems. The classification of ranking problems is quite wide. Problems with the following parameters will be considered for the application of the GV-median nearest search algorithm: expert information about the relationship on the set of objects is used: from the expert committee; input information: individual expert assessments; metric for determining the distance between object ranks in the decision space: the module of differences between object ranks; class of relations between objects for which algorithms for finding a solution are built: strict rankings of objects; type of criterion of optimality of the optimization problem: minimax criterion. Software implementation. Python language was chosen for software implementation. One of the most influential disadvantages of Python is the speed of code execution, however, Python programs are usually written much faster due to the relative conciseness of the language and a wide range of libraries. In addition, using Python increases the readability of the code for other developers. Algorithm of the nearest search of the GV-median. The nearest search algorithm can be represented by a sequence of the following steps: Step 1. The input is k rankings of n objects that will be designated Ri , i  1,..., k, and represented as a matrix Ak, n. (1) Let us transform the matrix of object numbers Ak, n in individual rankings of the form (1) into the corresponding matrix of object ranks B k, n. Step 2. Calculate the distance matrix D k, k  between the rankings of the form by the rank mismatch metric using the formula n i\\tj\\ti\\tj l\\tl (2) where l 1 i denotes the rank of l object in the ranking of i expert Step 3. We look for the maxima along the rows of the matrix D(k,k), and among them we determine the minimum (or minima, if this value is not the only one). This minimum corresponds to the modified GV-median (also called the compromise median). The solution may not be unique. We track the row from which the GV-median was taken and look at the distances for which rankings were calculated in it. This ranking will be considered as a reference. Define the vector of ranks of the reference ranking as Ko  r0 ,..., r0 , and by Ro  a0 ,..., a0 , denote the order of objects in 1\\tn\\t1\\tn the reference ranking. Step 4. Around the reference ranking we look for the closest to it, that is, those that are at a distance of 2. Their number is exactly n 1 ranking. To do this, it is necessary to swap the neighboring elements in pairs and calculate the distance matrix and the modified GV-median for them. If the new median delivers a lower criterion value, it becomes the new reference. The ranking obtained in the end is the closest to the rankings set by the experts for the given criteria. Computational experiment. The tendency of increasing time consumption with increasing number of objects and experts is obvious. By conducting a computational experiment, we will determine the specific time required to solve problems of different dimensions. The computational experiment was conducted for variations of different parameters: with a fixed number of experts k  10 and a variable number of objects 4  n  50 , as well as with a fixed number of objects n  10 and a variable number of experts 4  k  50 . The results of the computational experiment are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Figure 1. Time in seconds to solve the problem with the number of experts 10 k  10 and the number of objects in the rankings from 4 to 50 4  n  50 With a fixed number of objects and a variable number of experts, it is expected that the dependence of the solution time on the number of experts is close to linear. Figure 2. Time in seconds to solve the problem for the number of objects in the rankings 10 n  10 and the number of experts from 4 to 50 4  k  50 It should be noted that the time complexity of the constructed algorithm for the nearest median search is O k 2n2  . The computational experiment also investigated the percentage of improvement of the result compared to the reference ranking. The results are presented in Figure 3. It is obvious that for a small number of experts k  10 the improvement reaches 30% on average. For a larger number of experts 10  k  50 the improvement reaches about 15%. At the same time, the improvement rate of the result when applying the genetic algorithm was only 3-5% [2], however, for a large number of objects n  500. Figure 3. Percentage of improvement of the result (criteria values at the GV- median) for the number of objects n  10 and the number of experts from 4 to 50 4  k  50 Conclusions. Humanity will not abandon the methods of solving the problems of collective coordination for a long time, because expert opinion is the only way to provide an assessment of objects, a full description of all the impacts on which is very complex and confusing. That is why the development and creation of new methods of working with expert assessments is necessary for more efficient use of available resources.    \n",

New malicious software fills the Internet every day. In this regard, the protection of personal data is currently an important task. The first stage of many computer attacks is intelligence, and one of its mechanisms is port scanning, which allows an attacker to find out which services are running on the desired system. It means that in the future it can prepare and conduct an attack against the detected services and their vulnerabilities. This article provides an information and describes host detection methods. Keywords: host, scanning, Nmap ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP. Internet users pay little attention to the protection of personal data, and they are good prey for hackers. The first step to mastering information is to collect it. Nmap is one of the most common tools for scanning target hosts. This article analyses the methods of their detection. A host is a computer or other device that communicates with other hosts on a network. Hosts on a network include clients and servers that send or receive data, services, or applications [1]. One of the first tasks when investigating any network is to reduce the set of IP ranges to a list of active or interesting hosts. Network and port scanners are the most common tools for collecting information using technical methods. Host discovery methods [2]: ARP scanning is used to scan the local Ethernet network. On most LANs, especially those using the private address ranges provided by RFC 1918, the vast majority of IP addresses are not in use at any given time. When Nmap tries to send a raw IP packet, such as an ICMP echo request, the operating system must determine a hardware destination address (ARP) that matches the target IP address so that it can properly address the Ethernet frame. This requires it to send a series of ARP requests. UDP scanning has no concept of a connection and no equivalent of a TCP SYN packet. If a UDP packet is sent to a closed port, the system will respond with an ICMP port unreachable message. The absence of such a message is interpreted as a port opening signal. However, if the port is blocked by a firewall, the method will return a false response that the port is open. If ICMP port missing messages are blocked, all ports will be displayed open. Also, a limit on the frequency of ICMP packets can be set, which also affects the results given by the method. Ping scanning is a basic network scanning technique used when you want to know which hosts on the network are on. In terms of network scanning, there are the following types of ICMP messages [3]: Type Echo Ping. Echo request messages are also known as ping packets. A commonly used scanning tool is Nmap to perform ping checks and easily identify available hosts. Type Timestamp Ping. A timestamp request message requests system time information from the target host. The response is in decimal format and displays the number of milliseconds since midnight GMT. Type Address Mask Ping. The address mask query message shows the subnet mask used by the target host. This information is useful when mapping networks and determining the size of subnets and network spaces used by organizations. Security-conscious organizations firewalls often filter incoming ICMP messages, so ICMP inspection is not effective. However, ICMP is not filtered on most networks because ICMP messages are often useful for troubleshooting network problems. TCP SYN scanning is used by default. It can be launched quickly and is capable of scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast connection, without being hindered by restrictive firewalls. This type of scanning is non-intrusive and unnoticeable because the TCP connection is never fully established. It works with any TCP stack, regardless of any specific platform features. TCP scanning using the connect system call is the default TCP scanning type when SYN scanning is not available. It occurs when the user does not have privileges to use raw packets or when scanning IPv6 networks. Instead of using raw packets like most other types of scanning, Nmap \"asks\" the operating system to establish a connection to the target machine on a specified port via the connect system call. TCP ACK scanning is similar to TCP SYN scanning. The difference is that the TCP ACK flag is set instead of the SYN flag. Such an ACK packet claims to acknowledge data over an established TCP connection, but no such connection exists. Therefore, remote hosts must always respond with an RST packet, revealing their existence in the process. TCP NULL, FIN and Xmas scanning. Sometimes TCP SYN scanning is not sufficiently stealthy. Some firewalls and packet filters monitor SYN packets to protected ports. There are also programs like Synlogger and Courtney that can detect such scans. The advanced scans discussed here can pass through said obstacles undetected. The common idea of these methods is that closed ports should respond to “unintelligible” packets (packets with unexpected, incorrect, invalid character combinations) with RSTs, while open ports should simply ignore such packets. FIN scan uses “unexpected” FIN packets as a probe, “Xmas tree” scan uses packets with FIN, URG and PUSH flags, null scan uses packets without flags [4]. Some operating systems ignore the standard and send RSTs from open ports when they should simply skip (discard) the packet. Therefore, these types of scans will not work against such systems. IP protocol scanning. This type of scan allows you to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by the target machines. Technically, such scanning has ceased to be a type of port scanning, for which IP protocol numbers are cycled instead of TCP or UDP port numbers [5]. Although the - p option can be used here to select the protocol numbers to scan, the results are output in a port table format, and even use the same scanning engine as the various port scanning options. Figure 1 – Host discovery methods using the NMAP module Analysing the above, we can say that the main mechanism of intelligence is port scanning. It allows the attacker to find out which services are running on the target system and to prepare and conduct a targeted attack against the services and their vulnerabilities. The most common information gathering tools are network and port scanners. Among the well-known network scanning methods are:    \n",

This work is devoted to the problem of message transmission protection in an unsecured communication channel. It presents possible enhancements of message transmission protection by symmetric encryption creating image arrays using one-way math operations to mix public and private keys and a modified Diffie-Hellman method as a way to exchange private keys in an insecure channel. Keywords: images, Diffie–Hellman method, symmetric encryption, rgb. Nowadays the development of information systems and technologies, global computer systems and multimedia means, the question of ensuring the reliability and safety of data stored in digital form, as well as their reproduction and transmission through information communication channels is becoming more and more urgent and is getting more and more attention than ever. Even ordinary Internet users can become victims of an attack on their personal data or correspondence, as well as small and large companies. So, the focus of our work is on correspondence between users and its protection. One of the solutions that seems most promising is based on computer stenography, an encryption technique, the existence of which an average person is unaware of as there is no substantial evidence about such information or data. According to the basic principle of shorthand, a small amount of critical data is usually mixed with an array of information in such a way that an average user will not be interested in it. One of these arrays can be the most common available media files, e.g., audio, video and images. According to RAS research, about 1.13 trillion photos were taken in 2020 [1]. This means that if we divide this value by the number of people who have a phone or a camera, it will be about 211 photos per person. So, this conveys that most people already have a large number of unique photos in correspondence, which can be used as public keys. Furthermore, lots of people have personal messages that they have not published anywhere and have not forwarded, in case if there is none, then one can take their phone, take a photo and in a minute, they will have a unique private photo. These photos can act as a private key. At this stage, there may be doubts about the use of the symmetric method of encrypting future messages, as it is possible to use an asymmetric one. Still, we will consider the case when it is planned to exchange a large number of messages, and for this the symmetric model is for sure the favourite [2]. The model situation presupposes that you and your interlocutor have public keys and each of you has your own private key. The next step it to exchange private keys so that they are not declassified. The Diffie-Hellman method can be appropriate for this task, which is the use of a one-way mod operation with prime numbers. This method is based on the use of prime numbers for maximum security. So now we have a method of transferring two keys, but the question is raised how to move from theory to practice. The first proposal was to use prime numbers up to 256, that is, to generate a photo by choosing for each of the rgb colors a random prime number in the range from 0 to 255. But, firstly, there are only 53 of such numbers. Secondly, the remainder of dividing by some of them, such as 2 or 3, is too easy to calculate, so they should also be removed. This leads to the fact that out of these 53 at least a couple of numbers will remain, and an image with exactly the same color may raise suspicion even among average users. Therefore, there put forward a method of creating a table that contains 256 prime numbers in ascending order is. In this case you and your interlocutor are able to choose any open image, and even maybe more than one. Furthermore, this solution has a particular advantage as we do not have to take only prime numbers as in the first method, which will significantly increase possible variations, and as a consequence will increase the level of protection of the offered method. There is an example in which mixing means taking a pixel from an open image, separately adding the corresponding color from the rgb of the closed and open image according to the formula (𝑔𝑘mod n)mod 256, where n is a prime number from the table with the corresponding index, which is equal to the value of the base color in the open image, k is the value of the base color in closed + 1 (to avoid the 0 power), g is the product of the values from the table with indices equal to the other two values of the base colors in the open image. There is given an example of Alice and Bob to consider. If to put it briefly, Figure 1 demonstrates how it works, with the remark that instead of four colors, all pixels are presented in the image. That is, Bob takes and mixes his closed image with the open one, and gets the image that he will send to Alice. She, in her turn, performs the same operation and sends the public image mixed with her private key. Next, Bob mixes his closed image with what Alice sent him, and she in her turn performs the same action with what Bob sent to her. In this way, these two will receive the same images that they exchanged in an unsecured channel. That is, if an attacker intercepts all their messages, he will not receive the same image as these two.

       "      <td>Abstract. The paper considers the use of blockchain for data storage. The main problems in use and possible ways to solve them are considered. Introduction At the heart of the blockchain is a sequence of blocks, each of which carries a certain amount of information. This volume is limited by the technical implementation of the blockchain. The limit shows the maximum file size that can be uploaded to the blockchain. This is sufficient for storing transaction information, however, if you need to store a larger file, you need to look for another solution. Basic material The problem of limiting the maximum block size can be solved in several ways. The simplest of them implies: Splitting a file into segments smaller than the block size. Thus, even the largest file can be written to the blockchain with a small block size. Encryption of data in segments. This will allow you to store information in an open blockchain and be sure of its confidentiality. Distribution of segments on the blockchain network. Thanks to this, the file will be saved in an unchanged form as long as at least one user is synchronized with the blockchain. This approach is borrowed from torrent trackers, but it is not suitable for storing data using the blockchain, even if you remove the fees for creating transactions, for the following reasons: Recording of information in the blockchain is carried out using transactions, which, in turn, require confirmation. A large file can take several thousand transactions, that is, several hours or even days of processing. Information in the blockchain is immutable. Therefore, you cannot delete or modify unnecessary data. All the files that got into the network and their variations will forever remain in the blockchain and theoretically someone will be able to view them sooner or later. Immutability will lead to another problem – an avalanche of blockchain size. If information cannot be deleted, it will only accumulate, eventually making the size of the blockchain too large. Let's consider several examples of using blockchain to store information: BigChainDB cloud storage with huge volume and very fast transactions, it is built on the RethinkDB cluster and uses NoSQL mechanisms to store blocks, thanks to which it has high fault tolerance and bandwidth. BigchainDB is a scalable blockchain database. It is designed to combine the best properties of distributed databases and blockchain. Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform secured by blockchain technology. Sia's storage network uses hard drive capacity around the world, which is used to create a more reliable and cheaper way to store data than traditional cloud storage providers. Sia has its own blockchain and utility token that ensures its operation - Siacoin. MaidSafe is a decentralized internet project. The concept of MaidSafe predates Bitcoin by several years, although it is currently still in beta. When the SAFE network is complete, it will work similarly to the TOR network, meaning that the distribution and access of Internet content will be done in a P2P core network. Conclusion So, there are various options for data storage, but when using the blockchain, it is important to remember that current technologies do not allow storing large amounts of information inside the block chain. Therefore, the blockchain in this industry is used as an intermediary and ledger that monitors compliance with the terms of the agreement on providing storage from one person to another.</td>\n",

       "9   Abstract. The paper considers the use of blockchain for data storage. The main problems in use and possible ways to solve them are considered. Introduction At the heart of the blockchain is a sequence of blocks, each of which carries a certain amount of information. This volume is limited by the technical implementation of the blockchain. The limit shows the maximum file size that can be uploaded to the blockchain. This is sufficient for storing transaction information, however, if you need to store a larger file, you need to look for another solution. Basic material The problem of limiting the maximum block size can be solved in several ways. The simplest of them implies: Splitting a file into segments smaller than the block size. Thus, even the largest file can be written to the blockchain with a small block size. Encryption of data in segments. This will allow you to store information in an open blockchain and be sure of its confidentiality. Distribution of segments on the blockchain network. Thanks to this, the file will be saved in an unchanged form as long as at least one user is synchronized with the blockchain. This approach is borrowed from torrent trackers, but it is not suitable for storing data using the blockchain, even if you remove the fees for creating transactions, for the following reasons: Recording of information in the blockchain is carried out using transactions, which, in turn, require confirmation. A large file can take several thousand transactions, that is, several hours or even days of processing. Information in the blockchain is immutable. Therefore, you cannot delete or modify unnecessary data. All the files that got into the network and their variations will forever remain in the blockchain and theoretically someone will be able to view them sooner or later. Immutability will lead to another problem – an avalanche of blockchain size. If information cannot be deleted, it will only accumulate, eventually making the size of the blockchain too large. Let's consider several examples of using blockchain to store information: BigChainDB cloud storage with huge volume and very fast transactions, it is built on the RethinkDB cluster and uses NoSQL mechanisms to store blocks, thanks to which it has high fault tolerance and bandwidth. BigchainDB is a scalable blockchain database. It is designed to combine the best properties of distributed databases and blockchain. Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform secured by blockchain technology. Sia's storage network uses hard drive capacity around the world, which is used to create a more reliable and cheaper way to store data than traditional cloud storage providers. Sia has its own blockchain and utility token that ensures its operation - Siacoin. MaidSafe is a decentralized internet project. The concept of MaidSafe predates Bitcoin by several years, although it is currently still in beta. When the SAFE network is complete, it will work similarly to the TOR network, meaning that the distribution and access of Internet content will be done in a P2P core network. Conclusion So, there are various options for data storage, but when using the blockchain, it is important to remember that current technologies do not allow storing large amounts of information inside the block chain. Therefore, the blockchain in this industry is used as an intermediary and ledger that monitors compliance with the terms of the agreement on providing storage from one person to another.    \n",

       "      <td>Abstract. Everyone nowadays is aware of the value of investing in technology and the excess returns it provides. One of the trendiest technologies on the market right now is blockchain. For the first time ever, not only have investors made their fair share of investments in blockchain, but investment banks are also currently employing this technology. Keywords: card, blockchain, data exchange, online, transaction, financial institutions, cryptography, investing Blockchain technology can destroy not only the global currency market, but also the banking industry as a whole, replacing intermediaries with a reliable, limitless and transparent system that is easy to access for anyone. Blockchain can reduce the waiting time for transactions, make them cheaper, facilitate the process of access to capital, improve data security, ensure mutual fulfillment of obligations in agreements through smart contracts, as well as smoother compliance and much more. On top of that, thanks to the innovative nature of blockchain technology, the ways in which new blocks of transactions interact with each other could lead to completely new kinds of financial services. Information is kept in \"blocks\" that are connected together and are stored in a decentralized database called a blockchain. It performs extremely particular duties that set it apart from the conventional centralized database, including computing, storing, and analyzing the data contained in this database [1]. Using blockchain technology, money transfers and payments become decentralized. This has a number of implications for the financial sector [2]: Because the decentralized database is less vulnerable to data breaches, hacking, or the statistics being manipulated with, there is a decrease in fraudulent crimes and activities. This implies a more open financial system as well. Since blockchain technology relies on real-time payment executions, banks will be able to transfer payments at a faster rate. Additionally, it aids in promptly recognizing illicit activity and discovering irregularities in financial operations. Blockchain also prevents most human mistakes since data transmitted to the blockchain cannot be changed, altered, or tampered with once it has been sent. Additionally, everyone can see it. The intensity of interaction with technology grows annually. While from 2017 to 2019 the main priority was to learn blockchain in practice, in 2019 there was a shift in focus to patenting inventions. The problems faced by the Facebook and Telegram projects could play a certain role - Financial institutions are cautious, fearing regulatory risks. In addition, commercial expectations from the launched blockchain projects could not be justified. However, Financial institutions do not want to be left behind in the blockchain arms race and want to take their place in the emerging markets for blockchain solutions, which explains the increase in scientific developments and the transition to more closed formats of interaction with technology. Thus, the “blockchain revolution” continues and moves to a qualitatively new level, despite the decrease in the number of public blockchain projects. The largest financial institutions in the world continue to actively work with technology, investing both time and money in it [3]. How to ensure that transaction and wallet information is correct, complete and confidential and how to get access to your assets in conditions of anonymity: some of the issues that need to be addressed. There is a whole science of how to solve these problems - cryptography. Encryption is one of its methods. In blockchain networks, the buyer and seller of an asset confirm the transaction using cryptographic keys - special unique digital codes [4]. It is almost impossible to guess the sequence of characters of the digital code of cryptographic keys. This makes blockchain technology one of the best for financial transactions. But at the same time, there have already been cases of wallets being hacked, so it is better to connect them to the network only for the duration of transactions, and keep them offline the rest of the time.</td>\n",
